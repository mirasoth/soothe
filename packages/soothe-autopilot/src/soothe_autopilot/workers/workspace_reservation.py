"""WorkspaceReservation — scheduling-time conflict gate (RFC-222 revised).

Daemon-owned. Refuses to dispatch a new goal whose workspace prefix
overlaps with any goal currently active. Replaces per-path
``FileLockMiddleware`` for v1 (see RFC-222 Q1) — the registry is in the
daemon, the check happens before dispatch, so no cross-process RPC is
needed.

Conflict semantics (when ``strict_overlap`` is True, the default):
- ``/foo/bar`` conflicts with ``/foo/bar/baz`` (parent vs child)
- ``/foo/bar/baz`` conflicts with ``/foo/bar`` (child vs parent)
- ``/foo/bar`` does NOT conflict with ``/foo/barber`` (path component-aware)
- ``/foo/bar`` does NOT conflict with ``/foo/qux`` (siblings)
- Identical paths conflict.

When ``strict_overlap`` is False, only exact-path matches conflict.

Workspace paths are normalized (absolute, no trailing slash, no ``..``)
before comparison so equivalent paths compare equal regardless of input
shape.
