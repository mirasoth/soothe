"""Plan-mode step card suppresses execute prose (plan markdown) on completion.

In plan mode, the agent's final message IS the plan document. The plan review
card (``StructuredAskUserWidget`` with origin ``plan_mode_review``) already
renders the full plan body (formatted, collapsible). Showing the raw plan
markdown again on the step card is redundant — especially after a refinement,
where the old step card would display the *original* plan alongside the
*refined* plan review card.

These tests verify that the step card's detail panel does NOT render the
execute prose when ``interaction_mode == "plan"``, while still preserving
the prose for dedup (``last_completed_execute_prose`` property).
