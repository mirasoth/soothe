"""Thread-to-asyncio stream response bridge.

Eliminates poll-delayed delivery from worker threads into the daemon event loop.
Added backpressure handling to prevent unbounded queue growth.

NOTE: The semaphore backpressure here is a defensive optimization, not the root
fix for OOM. The root cause was LangGraph checkpointer channel history
loaded on every astream tick (see for details). Backpressure helps bound
in-flight chunks but alone did not resolve the memory leak.
