"""Native autoresearch rail execution helpers.

The `autoresearch` rail (`builtin_rails/autoresearch.yml`) uses YAML
`do:` recipes for `decompose_parallel` and `spawn_feedback_cycle` and
`brief:` overrides for `review` / `qa_verify`. The generic
`_do_plan_and_implement` fallback, however, spawns code-planning +
code-implementation goals with TDD / worktree discipline — wrong for research
synthesis.

This module supplies research-specific brief builders and a native
`plan_and_implement` dispatch path so the autoresearch rail synthesizes an
adaptive report from gathered evidence instead of writing production code.

Dispatch is rail-id-aware: `RailBuiltinExecutor.invoke` routes to
`AutoresearchExec.plan_and_implement` only when `state.rail_id ==
"autoresearch"`; all other verbs fall through to the generic `_do_*`
handlers or YAML `do:` recipes.
