    the worker's `SootheRunner.astream(autopilot_job=...)` path.

    **Terminology note:**
    - "Job" in /Desktop UX = user-facing term for a **root Goal** (persistent)
    - `GoalDispatchEnvelope` here = transient dispatch **message** (not stored)

    Attached to `LoopRunRequest.autopilot_job` when present. The worker
    hydrates StrangeLoop from `merged_context` and executes `goal_description`,
    ignoring `LoopRunRequest.user_input`. When `None`, the worker runs
    solo-mode behavior — today's path, unchanged.

        goal_id: Daemon's canonical goal id.
        goal_description: Frozen at dispatch time.

            `ContextProjector`. Worker treats it as opaque.
