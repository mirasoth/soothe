    This is a **wire message**, not a persistent entity. Created by the daemon's
    ``AutopilotService`` when dispatching a goal to a subprocess worker, and
    consumed by the worker's ``SootheRunner.astream(autopilot_job=...)`` path.

    **Terminology note (RFC-228):**
    - "Job" in RFC-228/Desktop UX = user-facing term for a **root Goal** (persistent)
    - ``GoalDispatchEnvelope`` here = transient dispatch **message** (not stored)

    Attached to ``LoopRunRequest.autopilot_job`` when present. The worker
    hydrates StrangeLoop from ``merged_context`` and executes ``goal_description``,
    ignoring ``LoopRunRequest.user_input``. When ``None``, the worker runs
    solo-mode behavior — today's path, unchanged.

    Attributes:
        goal_id: Daemon's canonical goal id.
        goal_description: Frozen at dispatch time.
        merged_context: Pre-projected hydration bundle from the daemon's
            ``ContextProjector``. Worker treats it as opaque.
        deadline_seconds: Wall-clock budget for this attempt; ``None`` = no cap.
        attempt: 1 on first dispatch, N on retry/backoff.

    Consolidates fields previously passed ad-hoc to ``SootheRunner.astream()``,
    including thread/workspace binding that was mutated on the shared singleton
    via ``bind_execution_thread_for_loop()``.

    Workspace resolution (``resolve_workspace_path()``):
        - ``client_workspace`` set → use that path directly, or map via
          ``workspace_mapping`` / config ``workspace_mount`` when absent locally.

          hash uses ``user_id`` (or ``""``) with ``client_workspace_id`` or ``loop_id``.

    RFC-222 revised extension (additive): when ``autopilot_job`` is set, this
    request is dispatched by the daemon's ``AutopilotService``; the worker
    branches to a hydrate-from-bundle path. When ``None``, the worker runs
    today's solo-mode path. The ``LoopRunnerProtocol.run`` signature is
