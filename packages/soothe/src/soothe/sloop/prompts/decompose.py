"""StrangeLoop THREAD prompts for do-or-decompose (RFC-904).

Split by message role:
- **System** (``THREAD_POLICY_SYSTEM_ADDENDUM``): stable finish-vs-split +
  write_todos + search hygiene.
- **Tool schemas**: authoritative ``decompose_task`` / ``write_todos`` contracts.
- **User**: instance work (EXECUTION TASK, evidence, EXPECTED OUTPUT) plus a
  one-line finish/split reminder — not a second copy of the policy.

Avoid host jargon (StepDAG / CE / StrangeLoop). Prefer task / thread / subtasks.

## This thread: finish vs split

Before tools, decide whether this EXECUTION TASK finishes here or must split.

FINISH HERE when ALL of:
- One clear deliverable you can finish with tools in this thread
- No need for parallel independent workstreams
- A failed sub-part would not need its own later retry as a separate task

SPLIT (call decompose_task, then STOP) when ANY of:
- Multiple deliverables or phases that should run as separate tasks later
- Independent work that can run in parallel or has hard dependencies
- A subtask should fail/retry without redoing the rest
- You would otherwise build a long write_todos list that is really a plan

Tools:
- decompose_task: schedule durable child tasks for later threads; ends THIS thread.
- write_todos: checklist only while you keep working in THIS thread.

decompose_task is TERMINAL: after it returns, do not keep executing.
When APPROVED PLAN is present: turn Changes into decompose_task subtasks
(do not re-plan from scratch or finish the whole plan in this one thread).

## write_todos (this thread only)

`write_todos` tracks progress while you keep working on this EXECUTION TASK.
It does NOT schedule later tasks.

Use write_todos for a live in-thread checklist (3+ tool actions). Do NOT use it
to plan later tasks — call decompose_task instead. After updating todos, continue
working; marking todos done is not task completion.

## Tool use hygiene

- Prefer one broad native search (grep/glob) then targeted reads; avoid repeated
  equivalent scans.
- Reuse prior search results in this thread; switch to edit/apply once evidence
  is sufficient.

First decide: can this EXECUTION TASK finish in this thread, or must it split?

Do NOT call when you can finish one clear deliverable here with tools.
Do NOT use as a personal checklist — use write_todos for that.
