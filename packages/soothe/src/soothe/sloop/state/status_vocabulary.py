"""Status vocabulary bridge across CE, checkpoint goal index, and loop checkpoint.

Three parallel status namespaces coexist in production (RFC-225, RFC-624, RFC-626):

- **ContextEngine** ``GoalStatus``: ``pending``, ``active``, ``completed``, …
- **Goal index** (``GoalIndexEntry.status``): ``running``, ``completed``, ``failed``, ``cancelled``
- **Loop checkpoint** (``StrangeLoopCheckpoint.status``): ``idle``, ``running``

Callers MUST translate at persistence/recovery boundaries instead of comparing raw
strings across layers.
