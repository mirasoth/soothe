"""Interactive (TUI relay) clarification policy (RFC-622).

The policy pauses the loop graph at a LangGraph ``interrupt(...)`` call. The
checkpoint snapshot captures the pending question, so TUI close/reopen and
daemon restart both restore the loop at the same point. When the TUI submits
the answer via ``Command(resume=...)``, ``interrupt(...)`` returns the payload
and the policy unwraps it into a :class:`ClarificationAnswer`.

``await_clarification`` owns the primary ``clarification_requested`` emit
(with the correct mode). This policy only re-announces when used as an
auto→manual upgrade (RFC-623 structured-output failure), via
:meth:`answer_as_manual_fallback`.
