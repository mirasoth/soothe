"""Intent classification Pydantic models (RFC-225, RFC-630).

Intent classification produces a 4-class intake label (RFC-630) —
``chitchat`` | ``trivial`` | ``simple`` | ``complex`` — that drives
``route_by_intent`` branch routing. Whether an agentic query continues an
in-flight loop is derived structurally inside ``StrangeLoop`` from the loaded
checkpoint, not classified here.

Two-pass intake (RFC-630 IG-554): Pass 1 (social vs task) → Pass 2 (scope).
Pass 1 returns ``is_task`` boolean; Pass 2 returns ``scope`` for work requests.

CoreAgent ``TaskComplexity`` / ``RoutingClassification`` are owned by
``soothe_sdk.intention.models`` and re-exported here.
