def expand_dependency_satisfaction_ids(completed_step_ids: Iterable[str]) -> set[str]:
    """Expand completed step ids with unambiguous local numeric suffix aliases.

    After ``assign_plan_step_ids``, successful steps are keyed by composite ids such as
    ``KFA-01``. Later plans may reference prior work using the model-local token ``01``
    (or ``1``) in ``dependencies``. Runtime completion sets only contained composite ids,
    so ready-step checks would block the entire wave without alias expansion.

    Adds **only** suffix tokens that map to **exactly one** completed composite id
    with the same integer value.

    Args:
        completed_step_ids: Definitive completed ids (typically from StepDAG or LoopState).

    Returns:
        Superset of ``completed_step_ids`` including safe aliases.
