"""Regression test for daemon-clobbered status recovery.

Reproduces the failure mode where the daemon's pre-query
``update_loop_metadata`` overwrites ``status="idle"`` (left by
``finalize_goal``) back to ``status="running"`` while
``current_goal_index`` stays at ``-1``. The fix lives in two places:

1. ``strange_loop.py``: when status=running + invalid index but goal_history
   has completed goals, take the idle-continuation path (preserve history,
   append new goal) instead of wiping.
2. ``postgres_backend.update_loop_metadata``: drop ``status`` from external
   writes when goal_history is non-empty (StrangeLoop owns status then).

seed_loop_ledger_from_prior_goal is deleted.
CE ledger spans all goals via ce.load, so prior context is available
without explicit seeding.
