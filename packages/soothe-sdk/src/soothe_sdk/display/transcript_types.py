"""Transcript message models shared between TUI rendering and server-side card binding.

Lightweight dataclasses for chat history. The previous home was a CLI-side
transcript module; that path is now a re-export shim so existing CLI
imports continue to work.

These types intentionally have **no Textual / widget / rendering
dependencies** so the binder module can run inside the server runtime.
