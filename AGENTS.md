# Soothe Development Guide

> **Binding conduct for all agents and human contributors.** Compliance is mandatory; deviations require operator approval.

**Soothe** — a goal-driven orchestration framework for 24/7 autonomous agents. Extends `deepagents` with durable planning, reentrant loop state, and remote agent interop across a one-way monorepo dependency DAG.

**Read the rules files below before any non-trivial change.** Substantial work requires a design doc; minor changes follow commit/PR context. Run `./scripts/verify_finally.sh` before every commit. When in doubt, stop and ask.
