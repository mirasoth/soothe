# RFC Archive

This directory contains deprecated RFCs that have been archived after their 90-day deprecation period.

## Purpose

Archived RFCs are retained for historical reference and to maintain a complete record of the project's design evolution. These documents are no longer active and should not be referenced in new development.

## Archive Policy

RFCs are moved to this archive when:

1. They have been marked as **Deprecated** for a minimum of 90 days
2. They have been superseded by newer specifications
3. All dependent systems have been updated to reference replacement RFCs

For details on the deprecation process, see [RFC-900: RFC Deprecation List and Number Segment Reclassification Scheme](../../specs/RFC-900-deprecation-reclassification-scheme.md).
