# RFC-222: Autopilot and Goal Engine Architecture

**RFC**: 222
**Title**: Autopilot and Goal Engine Architecture (Daemon-Owned)
**Status**: Implemented (Partially Superseded) — see superseded-by notes below
**Kind**: Architecture Design
**Created**: 2026-05-27
**Revised**: 2026-05-28 — daemon-ownership pivot; StrangeLoop reframed as pure execution unit; bounded summarization via `GoalDispatchContextBundle` replaces in-memory lineage; `WorkspaceReservation` replaces per-path file-lock coordination. `GoalDispatchContext*` naming chosen to avoid collision with `GoalContext` already defined in RFC-217 (thread ecosystem) and RFC-200 (DAG snapshot for backoff).
**Dependencies**: RFC-000, RFC-201, RFC-204, RFC-221 (Loop Runner Protocol)
**Related**: RFC-200 (Goal Lifecycle), RFC-220 (Loop Orchestrator), RFC-403 (Events), RFC-229 (Cron Service for Autopilot)
**Supersedes (in part)**:
- Earlier RFC-222 §"Loop Pool Management", §"Lineage-Aware Loop Assignment", §"File Lock Conflict Resolution" — replaced by the design herein.
- RFC-200 §"Pull-Based Architecture" / §"StrangeLoop ↔ GoalEngine Integration": the inverted control flow ("StrangeLoop pulls from GoalEngine, GoalEngine never invokes StrangeLoop") is replaced by **autopilot push**: daemon's `AutopilotService` dispatches goals to StrangeLoop workers via the job contract. StrangeLoop never sees `GoalEngine`. RFC-200's backoff reasoning, evidence schema, and goal-directives sections remain authoritative.

**Superseded by (in part)**:
- **RFC-625 (AutopilotMonitor and ContextEngine Unification)** — deletes `GoalEngine` entirely (~1821 lines). All goal/step/ledger state consolidated into `ContextEngine`; autopilot scheduling migrated to `AutopilotMonitor`. **All `GoalEngine` references in this RFC are historical reference only.**
- **RFC-626 (Entity Model and State Management Consolidation — LoopState Elimination)** — consolidates all entity models under ContextEngine, eliminates `LoopState`, unifies ledger management. Job abstraction refined to operate directly on CE GoalNode entities without intermediate state containers. **Sections describing `LoopState` and legacy entity models are historical reference only.**

> ⚠️ **Historical Reference Notice**: The `GoalEngine` architecture described in this RFC has been superseded by RFC-625. The following sections remain for historical reference:
> - §"Architecture Position" (component model with `GoalEngine`)
> - §"GoalDispatchContext and ContextProjector" (legacy context projection)
> - §"GoalEngine Component" (entire component deleted)
> - §"WorkerPool and Sticky Affinity" (scheduling logic moved to `AutopilotMonitor`)
>
> Active implementations should reference RFC-625 (AutopilotMonitor/ContextEngine) and RFC-626 (entity models) instead.

## Abstract

This RFC defines the architecture for **daemon-owned autopilot**: one `AutopilotService` instance per daemon that composes `GoalEngine`, `WorkerPool`, `ContextProjector`, `WorkspaceReservation`, and `InternalEventBus`, and dispatches goals to fungible subprocess workers via the existing `LoopRunnerProtocol` (RFC-221). Workers run `StrangeLoop` as a pure execution unit — they hydrate from an immutable `GoalDispatchContextBundle`, execute one goal, and emit a `GoalCompletionChunk` that the daemon's autopilot consumes to advance the DAG.

This replaces the prior per-`SootheRunner` autopilot model in which goal state, file-lock state, and the loop pool lived inside subprocess `SootheRunner` instances and died at the end of each request. The daemon-owned model enables true 24/7 operation, cross-session coordination, crash recovery via persisted `GoalDispatchContextContribution`, and workspace-level conflict gating at scheduling time.

---

## Motivation

### The two-loop problem (gap B2 from production-readiness analysis)

Two unrelated "loop" concepts coexist in the codebase and never communicate:

1. **`AutopilotService.LoopHandle`** — abstract slot in `SootheRunner` memory (`core/autopilot/loop_pool.py:17`).
2. **`LoopRunnerFactory`** — one OS subprocess (`PoolLoopRunner`) or thread per client `loop_id` (`soothe-daemon/runner/factory.py:108`).

The daemon's "utility" `SootheRunner` (`server.py:217`) is never used to stream goals. Real streaming runs in subprocess `PoolLoopRunner`s, each constructing a **fresh `SootheRunner` per request** (`pool_runner.py:464`), and therefore a fresh `AutopilotService`, `GoalEngine`, `LoopPool`, and `FileLockRegistry` per request. Autopilot state lives and dies inside a single request/response cycle.

The consequence: autopilot today cannot outlive a request, cannot coordinate across sessions, cannot enforce file conflicts across workers, and cannot recover from daemon restarts. The HTTP `/autopilot/submit` endpoint writes files to a directory that nothing reads (gap M1).

### DAG composability problem

The prior design pinned a worker to a goal's parent for "context reuse." Real DAGs aren't trees:

- **Diamond joins** (G has parents A, B): which parent's worker hosts G? No principled answer.
- **Fan-out** (P has children C₁, C₂, C₃ in parallel): they can't all share P's in-memory state.
- **Backoff jumps** (G fails → resume at ancestor X): X's worker may be long gone.
- **Worker crash**: in-memory state is lost; the whole lineage dies.

In-memory continuity only handles linear-chain-on-one-worker. Every other shape forces summarization or worse.

### Goals

1. **Single autopilot, daemon-lifetime.** `AutopilotService` is constructed once during `SootheDaemon.start()` and runs until shutdown.
2. **StrangeLoop as pure execution unit.** StrangeLoop knows nothing about the DAG, sibling goals, the autopilot pool, scheduling, or cross-loop file conflicts. The job → worker → completion-chunk contract is the entire surface autopilot shares with StrangeLoop.
3. **Bounded summarization for DAG composability.** Cross-goal context flows as a serializable `GoalDispatchContextBundle` (kilobytes, not megabytes). Diamonds and fan-out compose naturally. Crash recovery is automatic.
4. **Workspace-level conflict gate at scheduling time.** Daemon refuses to dispatch two goals on overlapping workspace prefixes concurrently. Removes the need for cross-process file-lock RPC.
5. **Subprocess isolation preserved (RFC-221).** Workers still crash independently; the daemon still consumes their streams; cancellation still uses the existing `cancel_event`.
6. **Solo mode unchanged.** `soothe -p "do X"` bypasses autopilot entirely — no `GoalEngine`, no `GoalDispatchContextBundle`, no DAG.

---

## Architectural Invariant

> **StrangeLoop is the pure execution unit. Autopilot is the orchestrator.**
>
> StrangeLoop knows nothing about the DAG, sibling goals, the autopilot pool, scheduling, or cross-loop file conflicts. Autopilot knows everything about those — and feeds StrangeLoop one goal at a time through a value-typed contract.

This invariant gates every design choice. If a proposed change would require StrangeLoop to know about its siblings or about the DAG shape, it doesn't belong.

---

## Architecture Position

> ⚠️ **Historical Reference**: This section describes `GoalEngine` which has been superseded by `ContextEngine` (RFC-625). The component diagram and GoalEngine references are preserved for historical context only.

```

### Service Boundary Definition

**AutopilotService responsibilities (daemon-resident):**
- Accept task submissions via HTTP/CLI (`submit_task`) and scheduled tasks
- Run the scheduling loop (peek → project → assign → claim → dispatch)
- Manage `WorkerPool` (sticky affinity, idle release, deadline monitoring)
- Compute `GoalDispatchContextBundle` per dispatch via `ContextProjector`
- Consume worker streams; react to `GoalCompletionChunk`
- Drive backoff via `GoalEngine.fail_goal` (which schedules `BackoffReasoner` async)
- Enforce `WorkspaceReservation` at scheduling time
- Dispatch internal events through `InternalEventBus` (consumed by webhook subscribers, observability, etc.)
- Manage dreaming mode transitions
- Handle crash recovery on daemon startup

**Not responsible for:**
- Single-goal execution logic (`StrangeLoop` owns this)
- Plan/execute/reflect mechanics (RFC-201, RFC-220 own these)
- Tool/subagent execution (CoreAgent owns this)
- Subprocess lifecycle (`LoopRunnerFactory` owns this — autopilot is a consumer)

**StrangeLoop responsibilities (subprocess worker):**
- Hydrate `loop_messages` and plan ledger from `GoalDispatchContextBundle` on entry
- Drive plan/execute/reflect loop for the one goal at hand
- Emit `GoalCompletionChunk` exactly once, just before the terminal `done` chunk
- Cooperatively check `cancel_event` between chunks (existing mechanism)

**Not responsible for:**
- DAG state / multi-goal scheduling
- Other goals (sibling/parent/child)
- File-lock coordination across workers
- `GoalEngine` calls (`create_goal`, `ready_goals`, `complete_goal`, `fail_goal`)

## The Job and Stream Contracts

Defined in `soothe/protocols/runner.py`.

### Job Contract — Autopilot → Worker

```python
@dataclass
class LoopRunRequest:
    # … existing RFC-221 fields (thread_id, loop_id, workspace, user_input,
    #   config, autonomous, max_iterations, intent_hint, …) — unchanged

    # RFC-222: when set, this is an autopilot-dispatched job. When None,
    # this is a solo-mode request and StrangeLoop runs today's path.
    autopilot_job: AutopilotJob | None = None


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AutopilotJob:
    goal_id: str
    goal_description: str
    merged_context: GoalDispatchContextBundle      # pre-projected by daemon
    deadline_seconds: float | None         # wall-clock budget; None = no cap
    attempt: int                           # 1 on first dispatch, N on retry
```

Properties:
- `autopilot_job` is **optional**. Solo callers pass `None`. StrangeLoop branches on presence — no global config gates behavior.
- `merged_context` is **pre-computed in the daemon**. Worker never reads `GoalEngine`, never queries parents, never sees the DAG.
- `deadline_seconds` bounds runaway goals (closes gap H5).
- `attempt` lets the worker adapt strategy on retries without daemon-side prompt mutation.

### Refined Job Abstraction (RFC-626 Alignment)

> **Note**: RFC-626 (Entity Model and State Management Consolidation) refines the job abstraction to eliminate intermediate state containers (`LoopState`) and operate directly on ContextEngine entity model.

**Key refinements applied:**

1. **Entity Identity Unification**: `goal_id` in `AutopilotJob` references CE `GoalNode` directly, no intermediate `Goal` or `goal_history` entry.

2. **Metrics Consolidation**: Wave execution metrics (`tool_call_count`, `subagent_task_count`, etc.) stored in CE `WaveMetrics` property instead of `LoopState`.

3. **Context Bundle Source**: `merged_context` built from CE `CognitiveSubmodule.projection()` and `GoalNode.lineage`, eliminating dual `ContextProtocol` + `LedgerManager` ingestion.

4. **Completion Chunk State**: `GoalCompletionChunk.context_contribution` written directly to CE `GoalNode` and `EpisodicSubmodule`, no separate `GoalDispatchContextStore`.

**Migration Impact**:
- StrangeLoop reads `ce.wave_metrics` instead of `state.last_wave_*`
- Executor writes to `ce.ingest_cognitive()` instead of dual `context.ingest()` + ledger
- Completion handler updates CE GoalNode status directly via `ce.complete_goal()`

**Backward Compatibility**: Job contract (`AutopilotJob` dataclass) unchanged; only internal state management refined. Workers continue to hydrate from bundle, emit completion chunk.

### Stream Contract — Worker → Autopilot

Workers already emit `StreamChunk`s through the existing IPC pipe (`pool_runner.py:474`). RFC-222 adds **one new chunk type**, emitted exactly once just before the terminal `done` chunk:

```python
class GoalCompletionChunk(BaseModel):
    # Internal namespace per RFC-403 — never broadcast to external clients.
    type: Literal["soothe.internal.autopilot.goal_completion"] = (
        "soothe.internal.autopilot.goal_completion"
    )
    goal_id: str
    outcome: Literal["completed", "failed", "needs_replan"]
    goal_result: GoalResult                                # reuses existing type
    context_contribution: GoalDispatchContextContribution  # what this goal adds to DAG
    evidence: EvidenceBundle | None                        # populated when outcome == "failed"
```

`AutopilotService` subscribes to its own dispatched workers' streams and reacts when it sees `GoalCompletionChunk`. No new IPC mechanism — the streaming pipe is the single channel.

### Cancellation Contract

Reuse the RFC-221 `cancel_event` mechanism (`pool_runner.py:448`). Autopilot's `cancel_goal(goal_id)` resolves the assigned worker via `goal_engine.get_goal()`, calls `worker.runner.cancel()`, then transitions the goal to `failed` in the engine. StrangeLoop's cooperative check between chunks (`pool_runner.py:485`) is unchanged. Closes gap H8.

## GoalDispatchContext and ContextProjector

> ⚠️ **Historical Reference**: Context projection has been superseded by `ContextEngine` (RFC-625). The `GoalDispatchContextBundle` and `ContextProjector` described here are preserved for historical reference. See RFC-626 for the current entity model.

> **Naming note**: `GoalDispatchContext*` is distinct from `GoalContext` in RFC-217 (thread ecosystem + execution memory) and RFC-200 (DAG snapshot for backoff reasoning). Those concepts continue to exist; this RFC introduces a third, narrower concept: the bounded summary autopilot ships to a worker so StrangeLoop can hydrate without seeing the DAG.

### Why bounded summarization (not full-memory continuity)

| DAG shape | Bounded summarization (this design) | Full-memory continuity |
|---|---|---|
| Linear chain (A → B → C) | Project context forward | Ideal — keep the worker |
| Fan-out (P → C₁, C₂, C₃ parallel) | Each child snapshots P's bundle | Cannot run children from one in-memory state without process fork |
| Diamond join (A, B → G) | Union bundles in projector | No meaningful "merge two LLM working memories" operation exists |
| Backoff (G fails → resume at X) | Hydrate X's stored bundle | Requires X's worker still alive AND its state from when X completed |
| Worker dies mid-goal | Re-dispatch elsewhere with same bundle | Lose all in-memory state |

Full-memory continuity is only achievable for the linear-chain-on-one-worker case. Every other shape forces summarization or worse. The one production-relevant performance benefit (provider-side prompt cache) lives at the provider, not in our process — preserved under summarization as long as the prompt prefix stays stable.

### `GoalDispatchContextBundle` (hydration input)

Defined in `core/goal_engine/models.py`:

```python
class GoalDispatchContextBundle(BaseModel):
    """Immutable hydration input for StrangeLoop.

    Merged across all parents (depends_on ∪ informs) by ContextProjector.
    Bounded size — summaries, not raw transcripts.
    """
    prior_plan_steps: list[PriorStepSummary] = []
    files_touched: dict[str, FileTouchSummary] = {}  # path → hash + last op
    findings: list[ParentFinding] = []               # LLM-synthesized
    tool_call_summary: ToolCallStats = ToolCallStats()
    cached_system_prompt_hash: str | None = None     # for provider cache hit

    @model_validator(mode="after")
    def _enforce_bounds(self) -> Self:
        # Hard caps; ContextProjector respects same caps on merge
        ...
        return self
```

### `GoalDispatchContextContribution` (worker output)

What this goal's execution adds to the DAG's context pool:

```python
class GoalDispatchContextContribution(BaseModel):
    plan_steps_executed: list[StepSummary]
    files_touched: dict[str, FileTouchSummary]
    findings: list[Finding]
    tool_call_stats: ToolCallStats
```

Daemon stores it keyed by `goal_id` in `GoalDispatchContextStore` and feeds it to children via `ContextProjector`.

### `ContextProjector`

```python
class ContextProjector:
    """Builds a GoalDispatchContextBundle from a goal's parents.

    Bounded — picks the K most relevant context elements rather than
    blindly unioning. Relevance is heuristic (recency + files overlap
    with the new goal's description) for v1; pluggable for future
    LLM-scored projection.
    """

    async def project(self, goal: Goal) -> GoalDispatchContextBundle: ...
```

Merge rules:
- **Files**: dedup by path, latest hash wins
- **Findings**: concatenate, truncate to top-K by relevance
- **Plan steps**: union, prefer recent N
- **Tool stats**: aggregate
- **Cached prompt hash**: take from most recent parent (for cache hit)

### `GoalDispatchContextStore`

Thin wrapper over `DurabilityProtocol`:
- `put(goal_id, contribution)` — called on completion
- `get(goal_id)` — called by projector
- `delete_for_root(root_goal_id)` — called when a root goal's DAG ages out (per Q3, default 168h after root reaches terminal state)

---

## Goal Lifecycle & DAG

### Goal lifecycle states (unchanged)

Per RFC-204 — 7 states: `pending`, `active`, `validated`, `completed`, `failed`, `suspended`, `blocked`.

### Autopilot-specific Goal fields (revised)

Already present on `GoalNode` (ContextEngine / RFC-626):
- `assigned_loop_id: str | None` — live assignment loop id while the goal is active
  (format `autopilot__{job_id}__{uuid}` per IG-677; cleared when the assignment ends)
- `locked_files: list[str]` — **reserved for future fine-grained locking; unused in v1**
- `lock_status`, `lock_acquired_at` — **reserved for future fine-grained locking; unused in v1**

> **IG-677**: Durable job↔loop membership is **not** `assigned_loop_id` alone.
> `JobLoopIndex` (`autopilot:job_loops:{job_id}` / `autopilot:loop_owner:{loop_id}`)
> records assignment history. Pool **slots** (`autopilot__slot_NNN`) are capacity
> handles; each dispatch allocates a fresh assignment `loop_id` under
> `data/loops/{loop_id}/`.

### `peek_ready_goals` and `claim_goal` (Phase 1 deliverables)

Already implemented (`engine.py:259-307`):
- `peek_ready_goals(limit)` — read-only filter, no state mutation, no events
- `claim_goal(goal_id, *, loop_id)` — atomic activation with conflict re-check, stamps `assigned_loop_id`, emits transition event

Autopilot uses `peek_ready_goals` for capacity planning and `claim_goal` per-dispatch.

### Backoff reasoning (revised — async)

When `GoalCompletionChunk(outcome="failed")` arrives, autopilot calls `goal_engine.fail_goal(goal_id, evidence=…)`. The engine:
1. Updates goal status to `failed` (or `pending` if retry budget remains)
2. **Schedules `BackoffReasoner` as a separate async task** (does not block the dispatch loop)
3. When reasoner completes, applies `BackoffDecision` (may transition another goal to `pending` with new directives)
4. Emits `InternalGoalStateChangedEvent` for each transition

The scheduling loop is non-blocking — it does not await backoff reasoning. This closes the synchronous-LLM-call concern (Q6).

---

## WorkspaceReservation (replaces File Lock Conflict Resolution)

**Per Q1 from brainstorming**: workspace-level reservation enforced at scheduling time replaces per-path file-lock middleware.

### Why

Per-path file-lock conflict requires cross-process RPC because the registry lives in the daemon and the conflict check happens in a worker subprocess. That requires either a new IPC channel or batching all file ops through the daemon. Both are expensive.

Workspace-level reservation is a scheduling-time check in the daemon. It has no runtime cost in the worker. It catches the realistic conflict (two goals operating on overlapping workspace prefixes) which is by far the common case. Fine-grained per-path conflicts within a single workspace are deferred until they become a real problem.

### Specification

```python
class WorkspaceReservation:
    """Daemon-owned scheduling-time workspace conflict gate.

    Refuses to dispatch a new goal whose workspace prefix overlaps with
    any goal currently active or about to be dispatched.
    """

    def acquire(self, goal_id: str, workspace_path: Path) -> bool: ...
    def release(self, goal_id: str) -> None: ...
    def conflicts_with_active(self, workspace_path: Path) -> str | None: ...
```

Called from `AutopilotService.dispatch` immediately before `claim_goal`. If reservation fails, the candidate is deferred to the next tick.

### Preserved code

`FileLockRegistry` (`core/goal_engine/file_lock_registry.py`) and `FileLockMiddleware` (`middleware/file_lock.py`) are **preserved unwired** — they're correct implementations of fine-grained per-path locking that we'll revive if/when conflicts within a single workspace become a real production issue. Until then, they're dead-but-tested code.

This closes gaps B4 and B5 by replacement.

---

## Autopilot Scheduling Loop

### Lifecycle

```python
# In SootheDaemon.start():
self._autopilot_service = AutopilotService(
    daemon_cfg=self._daemon_config,
    agent_cfg=self._config,
    runner_factory=self._runner_factory,    # reuses RFC-221 LoopRunnerFactory
    durability=self._durability,
)
await self._autopilot_service.start()

# In SootheDaemon.shutdown:
await self._autopilot_service.stop()       # graceful drain, then force
```

### One tick of the scheduling loop

```
every poll_interval seconds, until shutdown_event:

  1. INTAKE
     drain scheduler.due_tasks() → goal_engine.create_goal(...)
     (HTTP/CLI submissions arrive via submit_task outside the tick)

  2. SCHEDULE
     ready = goal_engine.peek_ready_goals(limit = max_parallel_goals)
     for goal in ready:
         if not worker_pool.has_capacity():     break
         if workspace_reservation.conflicts_with_active(goal.workspace):
                                                continue   # defer
         bundle = await context_projector.project(goal)
         worker = await worker_pool.pick_worker(goal, prefer = sticky(goal))
         if not worker:                         break
         workspace_reservation.acquire(goal.id, goal.workspace)
         await dispatch(goal, bundle, worker)   # fire-and-stream

  3. MONITOR
     for active worker: check deadline, heartbeat → cancel/replace as needed

  4. IDLE RELEASE
     release workers idle past loop_idle_timeout

  5. DREAMING
     if goal_engine.is_complete():
         enter dreaming mode (poll less frequently until woken)
```

The tick **does not await goal completion**. Dispatch fires an async task that consumes the worker's stream; reaction happens asynchronously.

### `dispatch()` and stream consumer

```python
async def dispatch(self, goal, bundle, worker) -> None:
    claimed = await self._goal_engine.claim_goal(goal.id, loop_id=worker.loop_id)
    if not claimed:
        self._workspace_reservation.release(goal.id)
        await self._worker_pool.return_to_idle(worker)
        return

    request = LoopRunRequest(
        loop_id=worker.loop_id,
        thread_id=f"autopilot__goal_{goal.id}__attempt_{goal.retry_count + 1}",
        user_input="",
        autopilot_job=AutopilotJob(
            goal_id=goal.id,
            goal_description=goal.description,
            merged_context=bundle,
            deadline_seconds=worker.compute_deadline(goal),
            attempt=goal.retry_count + 1,
        ),
        config=self._agent_cfg,
        autonomous=True,
        max_iterations=self._agent_cfg.autonomous.max_iterations,
    )

    worker.active_task = asyncio.create_task(
        self._consume_worker_stream(goal.id, worker, request)
    )
```

```python
async def _consume_worker_stream(self, goal_id, worker, request) -> None:
    try:
        async for chunk in worker.runner.run(request):
            await self._route_chunk(goal_id, worker, chunk)
    except Exception as exc:
        await self._handle_worker_crash(goal_id, worker, exc)
```

`_route_chunk` dispatches by type:
- Most chunks → forward to clients subscribed to `worker.loop_id` (existing daemon broadcast path).
- `GoalCompletionChunk` → autopilot reacts:
  - `completed` → `goal_engine.complete_goal()` + `context_store.put()` + `workspace_reservation.release()` + `worker_pool.mark_idle()`
  - `failed` → `goal_engine.fail_goal(evidence=…)` (engine schedules `BackoffReasoner` async) + `workspace_reservation.release()` + `worker_pool.mark_idle()`
  - `needs_replan` → goal stays `active`, autopilot re-projects bundle (with backoff directives applied) and re-dispatches **without releasing** the worker (sticky continuation)

This is the **only place** the daemon reacts to worker outcomes — single chokepoint, easy to test.

### `WorkerPool` (sticky-affinity wrapper over `LoopRunnerFactory`)

```python
class WorkerPool:
    """Sticky-affinity wrapper around LoopRunnerFactory (IG-677)."""

    async def pick_worker(
        self, goal: Goal, *, job_id: str, prefer: str | None = None
    ) -> WorkerSlot | None:
        # 1. Prefer idle slot (by slot_id or last loop_id)
        # 2. Sticky: idle slot that recently ran any goal.depends_on
        # 3. Any idle slot (LRU) — rebind with a NEW assignment loop_id
        # 4. Spawn new slot under max_loops cap
        # 5. None — caller defers
```

**Slot vs assignment loop id (IG-677):**

| Id | Format | Role |
|----|--------|------|
| `slot_id` | `autopilot__slot_NNN` | Reusable pool capacity / sticky affinity key |
| `loop_id` | `autopilot__{job_id}__{uuid4().hex}` | Per-assignment runtime home under `data/loops/{loop_id}/` |

Idle slot reuse keeps the **slot** and allocates a **new** `loop_id` + runner so directories never mix jobs. The daemon filters `autopilot__*` out of client `subscribe_loop` requests — autopilot workers are not user sessions.

This softens lineage-pinning to *preference*: a child of a parent that just completed will likely land on the same **slot**, but gets its own assignment `loop_id`.

### Crash recovery

On daemon start, after restoring the CE DAG snapshot (and `JobLoopIndex`):
1. Scan goals for `status == "active"` — mid-flight when the daemon died.
2. Reset to `pending`, clear `assigned_loop_id`, increment `attempts_after_crash`, log loudly.
3. Mark stranded index entries `interrupted` (`JobLoopIndex.interrupt_active_loops`).
4. Scheduling loop picks pending goals on the next tick (new assignment `loop_id`s).

`GoalDispatchContextContribution` for completed parents is in durability — re-dispatch hydrates from there. One bundle's worth of work is the maximum re-execution loss per crashed goal. Closes gap H4.

## Internal EventBus (revised)

### Per Q8: no module-global singleton

`AutopilotService` constructs and owns its `InternalEventBus` instance. The bus is **injected** into every consumer (`GoalEngine`, `WorkerPool`, subscribers). The `get_internal_bus()` singleton from the current implementation is dropped — it created spooky-action-at-a-distance across test boundaries.

### Event namespaces (unchanged from prior RFC)

| Namespace | Bus | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `soothe.internal.goal.*` | Internal | DAG state transitions, ready notifications |
| `soothe.internal.loop.*` | Internal | Worker lifecycle, sticky scheduling |
| `soothe.internal.file.*` | Internal | (reserved — unused in v1 per Q1) |
| `soothe.internal.autopilot.*` | Internal | Service lifecycle, dreaming, pool changes |
| `soothe.cognition.*` | External | User-facing progress (existing) |
| `soothe.output.*` | External | User-facing output (existing) |

**Key principle**: internal events never leak to external clients (WebSocket, TUI). The daemon's chunk router filters them by namespace prefix.

### Subscribers

In daemon-owned autopilot, the natural subscribers are:
- `WebhookSubscriber` (bridges `InternalGoalStateChangedEvent` → HTTP POST to configured webhook URLs)
- `MetricsSubscriber` (Prometheus / OpenTelemetry exporters — future)
- `ObservabilityLogger` (structured audit log for backoff decisions — future, addresses gap M8)

The existing internal-event types declared in `core/events/internal_events.py` are reused; no new event types are introduced by this revision.

---

## Solo Mode (Unchanged)

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The `soothe --autopilot` CLI command (per Q7) **becomes a daemon client**: it posts to `/api/v1/autopilot/submit` and streams progress via WebSocket. Prints a clear error + start-daemon hint if the daemon isn't running. The legacy in-process multi-goal mode is removed.

---

## Configuration

Per IG-434 / current config, autopilot fields live under `agent.autopilot:`.
RFC-222 historically said `agent.autonomous:` — that key is obsolete; use
`agent.autopilot.enabled` (default `true`).

```yaml
agent:
  autopilot:
    enabled: true

    # Goal execution
    max_iterations: 10
    max_retries: 2
    max_parallel_goals: 16
    enable_dynamic_goals: true

    # Orchestration
    max_send_backs: 3
    checkpoint_interval: 10

    # Dreaming
    dreaming_enabled: true
    dreaming_consolidation_interval: 300
    dreaming_health_check_interval: 60

    # Scheduler / webhooks
    webhooks: {}

    # Loop pool (RFC-222) — AutopilotService worker management.
    max_loops: 16
    loop_idle_timeout: 300
    poll_interval: 5
    dreaming_poll_interval: 60

    # Context projection (RFC-222 revised) — bounds GoalDispatchContextBundle size.
    context_projection:
      max_findings: 20
      max_files: 50
      max_plan_steps: 30
      context_retention_hours: 168   # 1 week; per-root-goal eviction (Q3)

    # Workspace reservation (RFC-222 revised) — scheduling-time conflict gate.
    workspace_reservation:
      enabled: true
      strict_overlap: true           # treat any prefix overlap as conflict
```

> Full field list lives in `config/soothe.template.yml` under `agent.autopilot`.
> Production readiness gaps: [IG-678](../impl/IG-678-autopilot-ce-rails-production-readiness.md).

## Implementation Phases

**Phase A — additive scaffolding (no behavior change)**
1. Add `GoalDispatchContextBundle` / `GoalDispatchContextContribution` models + tests.
2. Add `AutopilotJob` + extend `LoopRunRequest.autopilot_job: AutopilotJob | None = None`. Existing callers pass `None`; tests unaffected.
3. Add `ContextProjector` + `GoalDispatchContextStore`. Unit tests, no callers yet.
4. Add `WorkerPool` wrapping `LoopRunnerFactory`. Unit tests, no callers yet.
5. Add `WorkspaceReservation`. Unit tests.

**Phase B — wire the new worker path (parallel to old)**
6. `SootheRunner.astream` branches on `autopilot_job`: if set, call new `_run_single_autopilot_goal`; else, today's path. Autopilot-job branch is callable but no production code calls it yet.
7. Daemon-side `AutopilotService` constructed in `SootheDaemon.start()` but `enabled=False` by default. Scheduling loop runs but no goals exist in its DAG.

**Phase C — cutover endpoint-by-endpoint**
8. HTTP `/autopilot/submit` and related endpoints route through live `AutopilotService`.
9. Goals submitted via HTTP flow through daemon's autopilot, get dispatched to workers via `LoopRunRequest(autopilot_job=…)`.
10. Run both paths in parallel for one release. Gather telemetry.

**Phase D — destructive cleanup**
11. Delete `SootheRunner._autopilot_service`. Delete `_execute_goal_via_autopilot`. Delete `_run_autonomous` multi-goal scheduling. Delete `initialize_autopilot`. Migrate `soothe --autopilot` CLI to be a daemon client.
12. Remove `autonomous=True` flag from `SootheRunner.astream` (no caller needs it).

Phases A and B are reversible; C is the cutover; D is irreversible — gated on a release cycle of clean telemetry.

## Open Questions (Resolved)

These were debated in the brainstorming session and locked as defaults:

| # | Question | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | File-lock granularity | **Workspace-level for v1.** `WorkspaceReservation` at scheduling time. Path-level deferred; `FileLockMiddleware` and `FileLockRegistry` preserved unwired. |
| Q2 | ContextProjector relevance heuristic | **Simple heuristic for v1** (recency + file overlap). Pluggable for future LLM-scored projection. |
| Q3 | `GoalDispatchContextContribution` eviction | **Per-root-goal + age.** When root reaches terminal state, contributions evictable after `context_retention_hours` (default 168h). LRU-evict if quota exceeded. |
| Q4 | Multi-tenancy | **Reject overlapping-workspace submissions** unless explicit shared-mode opt-in. Cross-tenant authz deferred to its own RFC. |
| Q5 | Solo + autopilot coexistence | **Yes**, with workspace-overlap check. Solo invocations register a transient workspace claim. |
| Q6 | Backoff reasoning | **Async fire-and-forget.** Engine schedules `BackoffReasoner` as a separate task; scheduling loop is non-blocking. |
| Q7 | CLI backwards compatibility (`soothe --autopilot`) | **Becomes a daemon client.** Requires daemon running; posts to `/autopilot/submit`, streams via WebSocket. |
| Q8 | `InternalEventBus` placement | **Drop the singleton `get_internal_bus()`.** Owned by `AutopilotService`; injected to all consumers. |

---

## Out of Scope (Explicit)

- **Distributed multi-daemon autopilot** (DAG sharded across daemons). Single-daemon only. Future RFC.
- **Streaming context updates mid-goal.** Workers emit one `GoalDispatchContextContribution` at end. Mid-flight context checkpointing is a future enhancement.
- **`GoalDispatchContextBundle` / `GoalDispatchContextContribution` schema versioning.** Bump model version; ad-hoc migration.
- **Cost / token-budget enforcement** (production gap H3). Future RFC; this design is the substrate it plugs into.
- **Fine-grained per-path file-lock conflict resolution.** Workspace-level reservation suffices for v1. `FileLockMiddleware` preserved unwired.

---

## Gaps This RFC Closes (from production-readiness analysis)

| Gap | Resolution |
|---|---|
| B1 — Scheduling loop never runs | Daemon owns `AutopilotService.start()` → continuous scheduling. |
| B2 — Two incompatible loop concepts | Resolved by collapsing to one: AutopilotService in daemon, StrangeLoop in worker. |
| B3 — GoalEngine state in-process only | Daemon-owned + `restore_from_durability()`. |
| B4 — File-lock registry per-process | Replaced by daemon-owned `WorkspaceReservation` (Q1). |
| B5 — FileLockMiddleware not installed | Replaced by workspace-level scheduling check (Q1). |
| H4 — No crash recovery for in-flight goals | Reset `active` → `pending` on daemon start; hydrate from `GoalDispatchContextContribution`. |
| H5 — No deadline / hang detection | `AutopilotJob.deadline_seconds` + monitor tick. |
| H8 — Goal cancellation not wired | `autopilot.cancel_goal()` + existing RFC-221 `cancel_event`. |
| M1 — Channel inbox disconnected | Resolved: file-based inbox removed; `/autopilot/submit` and related endpoints require live `AutopilotService`. |
| M9 — No integration tests | Phase C end-to-end test required before cutover. |

Remaining gaps (H1, H2, H3, H6, H7, M2–M8, M10) are deliberately out of scope and tracked for future RFCs.

## Guarded Production Pilot (Minimum Bar)

**Status**: Implemented (2026-07-01)

When `agent.autopilot.enabled=true` (the default), the following wiring is required before unattended 24/7 operation. This section tracks the **minimum bar** for a guarded pilot (deadlines, monitoring; set `enabled: false` to opt out).

### Configuration

| Setting | Pilot recommendation | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| `agent.autopilot.enabled` | `true` (default) | Master switch; scheduling loop does not start when `false` |
| `goal_deadline_seconds` | `1209600` (14 days) | AutopilotMonitor cancels workers past this wall-clock budget; `null` disables |
| `max_parallel_goals` | tuned to capacity | Service + runner semaphores |
| `verify_interval` | `30` | AutopilotMonitor DAG health cadence |

Pydantic default for `enabled` is **`true`** — set `agent.autopilot.enabled: false` to disable the scheduling loop.

### Daemon wiring (implemented)

1. **AutopilotService.start/stop** starts and stops **AutopilotMonitor** background loops (verification + dreaming timer).
2. **submit_task** routes through **AutopilotMonitor.intake_goal** when a monitor is wired (placement analysis path); falls back to direct `ContextEngine.create_goal` when no monitor.
3. **Consensus model**: `SootheConfig.create_chat_model("think")` tries the `think` router role, then **`default`** on instantiation failure when specs differ. Router resolution already maps unset `think` → `default`.

### Verification

| Test | Location |
|------|----------|
| Monitor lifecycle + intake routing | `packages/soothe/tests/unit/core/autopilot/test_monitor_lifecycle.py` |
| think→default model fallback | `packages/soothe/tests/unit/config/test_create_chat_model_fallback.py` |
| Enabled daemon starts scheduling + monitor | `packages/soothe-daemon/tests/integration/autopilot/test_autopilot_enabled_startup.py` |
| Real dispatch E2E (fake runner) | `packages/soothe/tests/unit/core/autopilot/test_real_dispatch.py` |

### Explicitly deferred (post-pilot)

- Full dreaming distillation persistence (procedure / semantic / profile modes)
- Backoff decision application in AutopilotMonitor
- StrangeLoop proposal tools (`suggest_goal`, `add_finding`)
- Webhook notifications
- Token-budget enforcement (gap H3)
- Per-loop solo/autopilot toggle (removed; use `/autopilot` job submit + `agent.autopilot.enabled`)

### Production gaps from long-running eval (2026-08-04)

Tracked in [IG-680](../impl/IG-680-autopilot-dag-health-evidence-deps.md) (not
optional soak — these break job-status honesty):

| Gap | Impact | Fix home |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Subgoals omit `parent.workspace` | Workers write under `~/.soothe/data/workspaces/anonymous/ws_*` while the job workspace is the client path; consensus rejects “wrong” paths | IG-680 P0-3; RFC-625 errata |
| `GoalDispatchContextContribution.files_touched` empty | Consensus sees restated goal text → false `send_back` | IG-680 P0-4/P0-5; RFC-204 note |
| DAG health auto-cancels umbrella roots | Job status `cancelled` despite workspace success | IG-680 P0-1; RFC-625 remove policy |
| Flat `depends_on` after decompose | Test/review race implement | IG-680 P1; RFC-625 `wire_dependencies` |

**Invariant addendum:** When `AutopilotJob.workspace` (or root `GoalNode.workspace`)
is set, every descendant created by monitor/health/worker decompose MUST inherit
that workspace unless an intake explicitly overrides it. Workspace reservation
still gates overlapping **distinct** workspaces; same-job children share one
reservation key via the inherited path.

## Changelog

### 2026-05-27 (Draft)
- Initial RFC draft defining Autopilot + GoalEngine architecture
- Internal EventBus specification with `soothe.internal.*` namespace
- Goal-AL exclusive assignment and file lock conflict resolution
- Lineage-aware loop reuse for context preservation
- Solo mode preserved (no GE integration) vs Autopilot mode (GE active)
- Channel and webhook integration patterns

### 2026-05-28 (Revised — daemon-ownership pivot)
- **AutopilotService moved to daemon ownership.** One instance per daemon, constructed at `SootheDaemon.start()`, lifetime = daemon lifetime.
- **StrangeLoop reframed as pure execution unit.** No GoalEngine, no AutopilotService, no DAG view inside subprocess workers.
- **Bounded summarization via `GoalDispatchContextBundle`** replaces lineage-based in-memory continuity. Composes for diamond joins, fan-out, backoff, worker crash. Linear chains still get warm caches via sticky scheduling.
- **`WorkspaceReservation`** replaces `FileLockRegistry` / `FileLockMiddleware` as the conflict gate. Enforced at scheduling time in the daemon. Fine-grained per-path locking preserved unwired (revivable when needed).
- **Job contract** added: `LoopRunRequest.autopilot_job: AutopilotJob | None`. Worker branches on presence; solo callers pass `None`.
- **Stream contract** added: `GoalCompletionChunk` emitted exactly once by worker, consumed by daemon's `_route_chunk`. No new IPC mechanism.
- **`WorkerPool` sticky-affinity wrapper** over `LoopRunnerFactory` (RFC-221). Autopilot ids namespaced as `autopilot__*` and filtered from client subscriptions.
- **Crash recovery** added: scan `active` goals on daemon start, reset to `pending`, re-dispatch.
- **Async backoff reasoning** — `BackoffReasoner` runs as a separate task; scheduling loop is non-blocking.
- **`InternalEventBus` singleton dropped** — bus owned by `AutopilotService`, injected to consumers.
- **`soothe --autopilot` CLI becomes a daemon client.** Legacy in-process multi-goal mode removed.
- Open questions Q1–Q8 explicitly resolved with defaults.

### 2026-07-01 (Guarded production pilot minimum bar)
- Documented **Guarded Production Pilot** section: config recommendations, monitor lifecycle wiring, intake routing, consensus model fallback.
- Implementation: `AutopilotService` starts/stops `AutopilotMonitor`; `submit_task` uses `intake_goal` when monitor wired; `create_chat_model(consensus_model_role)` for daemon consensus model.

### 2026-08-04 (IG-677 Job↔Loop Index)
- Assignment `loop_id` is `autopilot__{job_id}__{uuid}` (unbounded); pool **slots** are separate reusable capacity keys.
- Durable `JobLoopIndex` records job↔loop membership across restarts; live `assigned_loop_id` remains the in-flight pointer only.

### 2026-08-04 (IG-680 eval gaps)
- Documented production gaps: workspace inherit on decompose, consensus evidence
  grounding, health remove guardrails, pipeline `depends_on` wiring.
- Related errata in RFC-625; implementation backlog [IG-680](../impl/IG-680-autopilot-dag-health-evidence-deps.md).
