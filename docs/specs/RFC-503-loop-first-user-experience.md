# RFC-503: Loop-First User Experience Architecture

**RFC**: 503
**Title**: Loop-First User Experience Architecture
**Status**: Draft
**Kind**: Architecture Design
**Created**: 2026-04-22
**Updated**: 2026-04-22
**Authors**: Claude Sonnet 4.6
**Depends on**: RFC-207, RFC-450, RFC-500, RFC-454

---

## Abstract

This RFC defines the architectural shift from **thread-based user experience** to **loop-based user experience**. StrangeLoop becomes the primary user-facing concept, while CoreAgent threads become internal implementation details invisible to users. This aligns with RFC-207's vision: loops span multiple threads, users interact with loops, threads are execution contexts managed internally.

---

## Motivation

### Current Problem

**Thread-centric user model** (current):
- CLI: `soothe --thread <thread_id> "query"`
- TUI: Thread selector dropdown
- Daemon: Thread-level WebSocket APIs, thread subscriptions
- User mental model: "I work with threads"

**Architectural mismatch**:
- RFC-207 defines loops as primary entity spanning threads
- Users see threads, but loops are the orchestrating entity
- Thread IDs exposed to users, but loop_id is internal
- Thread detachment keeps thread running, but loop context is lost

### Proposed Solution

**Loop-first user model**:
- CLI: `soothe --loop <loop_id> "query"` (or default: active loop)
- TUI: Loop selector dropdown
- Daemon: Loop-level WebSocket APIs, loop subscriptions
- User mental model: "I work with loops"
- Threads: Internal implementation detail (invisible to users)

**Key principle**: Users interact with loops. Threads are execution contexts managed by StrangeLoop internally.

---

## Architectural Principle

### User Mental Model

**What users see**:
- **Loops**: Primary entity they create, manage, and interact with
- **Loop status**: `running`, `ready_for_next_goal`, `finalized`, `cancelled`
- **Loop goals**: Goals completed, goals in progress
- **Loop history**: Goal execution history across all threads

**What users don't see**:
- **Thread IDs**: Internal execution contexts
- **Thread switches**: Automatic (internal) when thread health degrades
- **Thread checkpoints**: Internal CoreAgent checkpoints
- **Thread lifecycle**: Managed internally by StrangeLoop

**Example user interaction**:
```
User: "soothe loop list"
System: Shows loops (loop_abc123, loop_def456)

User: "soothe loop describe loop_abc123"
System: Shows loop details:
  - Status: ready_for_next_goal
  - Goals completed: 5
  - Threads: 3 (internal, shown for context)
  - Checkpoint tree: ...

User: "soothe --loop loop_abc123 translate to chinese"
System: Executes query on loop (thread managed internally)
```

---

## CLI Architecture

### Command Structure

**Parent command**: `soothe loop <subcommand>` (replaces `soothe thread <subcommand>`)

**Subcommands**:

| Command | Description | Replaces |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `soothe loop list` | List all loops | `soothe thread list` |
| `soothe loop describe <loop_id>` | Show loop details | `soothe thread describe <thread_id>` |
| `soothe loop tree <loop_id>` | Visualize checkpoint tree | NEW |
| `soothe loop prune <loop_id>` | Prune old branches | NEW |
| `soothe loop delete <loop_id>` | Delete loop | `soothe thread delete <thread_id>` |
| `soothe loop switch <loop_id>` | Switch active loop | `soothe thread resume <thread_id>` |
| `soothe loop new` | Create new loop | NEW |
| `soothe loop status` | Quick status summary | NEW |

**Execution flags**:

| Flag | Description | Replaces |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `--loop <loop_id>` | Execute on specific loop | `--thread <thread_id>` |
| `--new-loop` | Create fresh loop for query | `--new-thread` (if existed) |
| `--loop-status` | Show loop status after execution | NEW |

**Default behavior**:
```bash
soothe -p "query"  # Uses active loop (or creates new loop if none active)
soothe --loop loop_abc123 -p "query"  # Execute on specific loop
soothe --new-loop -p "query"  # Create fresh loop for query
```

## TUI Architecture

### UI Components

**Welcome banner** (loop-based):
```
╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Welcome to Soothe                                              │
│                                                                 │
│  Active Loop: loop_abc123                                       │
│  Status: ready_for_next_goal                                    │
│  Goals: 5 completed, 1 in progress                              │
│  Threads: 3 (internal)                                          │
│                                                                 │
│  Commands:                                                      │
│    Ctrl+N - New loop          Ctrl+L - Switch loop              │
│    Ctrl+D - Detach loop       Ctrl+Q - Quit                     │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**Status bar** (loop-based):
```
Loop: loop_abc123 [ready_for_next_goal] | Goals: 5 | Threads: 3 (internal) | Tokens: 125K | Duration: 3h 15m
```

**Loop selector modal** (replaces thread selector):
```
Select Loop:
  ○ loop_abc123  (active, 5 goals, 3 threads)  ← Enter to select
  ○ loop_def456  (running, 3 goals, 2 threads)
  ○ loop_ghi789  (finalized, 10 goals, 5 threads)
  
  [Ctrl+N] Create new loop
```

**Loop history cards** (replaces thread cards):
```
Loop: loop_abc123
  Created: 2026-04-22 10:30
  Goals: 5 completed, 1 in progress
  
  Goal 1: "analyze project structure" ✓
    Duration: 45s
    Threads: 1 (started on thread_001)
  
  Goal 2: "optimize database queries" ✓
    Duration: 2m 30s
    Threads: 2 (thread switch after iteration 3)
  
  Goal 3: "translate to chinese" ✓
    Duration: 1m 15s
    Threads: 3 (thread switch for fresh context)
  
  Goal 4: "write unit tests" ✓
    Duration: 5m 20s
    Threads: 3 (continued on thread_003)
  
  Goal 5: "generate documentation" ⏳ (in progress)
    Threads: 3 (current thread_003)
```

**Thread switch notification** (internal, minimal disclosure):
```
[Info] Thread context refreshed for better performance (internal thread management)
```

Note: No thread ID shown. Users see "context refreshed" without internal details.

### Event Routing Changes

**Old routing** (thread-based) - removed:
```python
# REMOVED: Thread-scoped event topics
topic = f"thread:{thread_id}"  # ❌ Remove
await event_bus.publish(topic, event)
```

**New routing** (loop-based):
```python
# NEW: Loop-scoped event topics
topic = f"loop:{loop_id}"  # ✅ Add
await event_bus.publish(topic, event)

# Thread events are internal (not routed to clients)
# Only loop-level events are client-visible
```

**Client-visible events** (loop-level):
```python
# Loop lifecycle events (NEW)
LOOP_CREATED = "soothe.lifecycle.loop.created"
LOOP_STARTED = "soothe.lifecycle.loop.started"
LOOP_DETACHED = "soothe.lifecycle.loop.detached"
LOOP_REATTACHED = "soothe.lifecycle.loop.reattached"
LOOP_COMPLETED = "soothe.lifecycle.loop.completed"

# Goal events (existing, loop-scoped)
GOAL_CREATED = "soothe.cognition.goal.created"
GOAL_COMPLETED = "soothe.cognition.goal.completed"
GOAL_FAILED = "soothe.cognition.goal.failed"

# Branch events (NEW)
BRANCH_CREATED = "soothe.cognition.branch.created"
BRANCH_RETRY_STARTED = "soothe.cognition.branch.retry.started"

# StrangeLoop events (existing)
STRANGE_LOOP_STARTED = "soothe.cognition.strange_loop.started"
STRANGE_LOOP_COMPLETED = "soothe.cognition.strange_loop.completed"
```

**Internal events** (not client-visible):
```python
# Thread lifecycle (internal only)
THREAD_CREATED = "soothe.lifecycle.thread.started"  # Internal
THREAD_SWITCHED = "soothe.lifecycle.thread.switched"  # Internal (NEW)
THREAD_HEALTH_UPDATED = "soothe.lifecycle.thread.health.updated"  # Internal (NEW)

# Checkpoint anchors (internal)
CHECKPOINT_ANCHOR_CREATED = "soothe.lifecycle.checkpoint.anchor.created"  # Internal
```

```python
/thread list  # ❌ Remove
/thread describe <thread_id>  # ❌ Remove
/thread delete <thread_id>  # ❌ Remove

```

---

### New Loop-Level Commands

**New commands** (added to slash command registry):
```python
/loop list  # REPLACES /thread list

## SootheRunner Refactoring

### Loop-Scoped Execution

**Old SootheRunner** (thread-scoped) - removed:
```python
# REMOVED: Thread-scoped runner
class SootheRunner:
    def __init__(self, thread_id: str):  # ❌ Remove thread_id
        self.thread_id = thread_id
```

**New SootheRunner** (loop-scoped):
```python
# NEW: Loop-scoped runner
class SootheRunner:
    def __init__(self, loop_id: str | None = None):  # ✅ Add loop_id
        self.loop_id = loop_id or self._generate_loop_id()
        self.loop_manager = StrangeLoopManager(self.loop_id)
        self.thread_manager = ThreadManager()  # Internal
    
    async def run(self, query: str):
        """Run query on loop (manages threads internally)."""
        
        # Load loop checkpoint
        loop_checkpoint = await self.loop_manager.load_or_create()
        
        # Evaluate thread switch policy (internal)
        if self._should_switch_thread(loop_checkpoint):
            # Internal thread switch (invisible to user)
            new_thread_id = await self.thread_manager.create_thread()
            loop_checkpoint.thread_ids.append(new_thread_id)
            loop_checkpoint.current_thread_id = new_thread_id
            await self.loop_manager.save(loop_checkpoint)
        
        # Execute on current thread (internal)
        current_thread_id = loop_checkpoint.current_thread_id
        core_agent = await self._create_core_agent(current_thread_id)
        
        # Run with StrangeLoop orchestration
        sloop = StrangeLoop(self.loop_id, loop_checkpoint)
        result = await sloop.run_with_progress(
            core_agent=core_agent,
            query=query,
            thread_id=current_thread_id,  # Internal parameter
        )
        
        # Update loop checkpoint
        loop_checkpoint = await sloop.finalize()
        await self.loop_manager.save(loop_checkpoint)
        
        return result
```

## Client Session Management

### Loop-Scoped Sessions

**Old session** (thread-based) - removed:
```python
# REMOVED: Thread-scoped session
class ClientSession:
    thread_id: str  # ❌ Remove
    thread_subscriptions: set[str]  # ❌ Remove
```

**New session** (loop-based):
```python
# NEW: Loop-scoped session
class ClientSession:
    loop_id: str  # ✅ Add (primary user-facing identifier)
    loop_subscription: str | None  # ✅ Single loop subscription
    
    # Internal thread tracking (for cleanup)
    internal_thread_ids: set[str]  # Internal: threads owned by this loop
```

**Session lifecycle**:
```python
async def handle_loop_subscribe(client_id: str, loop_id: str):
    """Subscribe client to loop (replaces thread subscribe)."""
    
    session = session_manager.get_session(client_id)
    
    # Unsubscribe from old loop
    if session.loop_subscription:
        await event_bus.unsubscribe(session.loop_subscription, session.event_queue)
    
    # Subscribe to new loop
    topic = f"loop:{loop_id}"
    await event_bus.subscribe(topic, session.event_queue)
    
    # Update session
    session.loop_id = loop_id
    session.loop_subscription = topic
    
    # Reconstruct history (for TUI reattachment)
    loop_checkpoint = await loop_manager.load(loop_id)
    event_stream = reconstruct_event_stream(loop_checkpoint)
    
    # Send history replay
    await session.send_event({
        "type": "history_replay",
        "loop_id": loop_id,
        "events": event_stream,
    })
```

---

## Detachment Behavior

### Loop Detachment

**Old detachment** (thread-based) - removed:
```python
# REMOVED: Thread detachment
/detach thread_001  # ❌ Remove

# Behavior: Thread continues running, client unsubscribes from thread
```

**New detachment** (loop-based):
```python
# NEW: Loop detachment
/detach loop_abc123  # ✅ Add (or default: active loop)

# Behavior:
# - Loop continues running (all threads continue)
# - Client unsubscribes from loop (not individual threads)
# - Loop checkpoint saved at detachment point
# - On reattachment: reconstruct full history from loop checkpoint
```

**Reattachment workflow**:
```python
# Client reattaches to detached loop
await handle_loop_subscribe(client_id, loop_abc123)

# Daemon reconstructs history:
# 1. Load StrangeLoop checkpoint (loop_abc123)
# 2. Load checkpoint tree (main_line + failed_branches)
# 3. Load CoreAgent checkpoints (internal)
# 4. Reconstruct event stream (goal history + checkpoint anchors)
# 5. Send history replay to client
# 6. Send current loop status
```

## Implementation Tasks

Migration spans six layers: CLI (`soothe thread` → `soothe loop` commands, `--thread` → `--loop`, new `tree`/`prune`/`switch`/`new`/`status` subcommands); TUI (loop selector, status bar, history cards, internal-only thread switch notification, loop-based welcome banner); daemon protocol (remove thread-level WebSocket APIs, add loop-level APIs, replace thread subscriptions with loop subscriptions, switch event routing to loop topics); slash commands (remove `/thread`, add `/loop`, scope existing commands to loop); SootheRunner (loop-scoped execution with internal thread_manager); and session management (loop-scoped sessions, loop checkpoint reconstruction on reattach).
