# RFC-630: Start-Phase LLM Intake and Branch Routing

**RFC**: 630
**Title**: Start-Phase LLM Intake and Branch Routing
**Status**: Draft
**Kind**: Architecture Design
**Authors**: Xiaming Chen
**Created**: 2026-06-30
**Updated**: 2026-08-19
**Depends on**: RFC-220, RFC-225, RFC-226, RFC-503
**Supersedes**: The `_is_likely_agentic` heuristic bypass and `simple_bypass` string-prefix detection introduced by IG-518.
**Related**: RFC-214, RFC-604, RFC-624, RFC-628, RFC-904

## 1. Abstract

The start-phase pipeline — from user goal arrival to the first task submitted to CoreAgent — uses a **two-pass intake architecture** that cleanly separates social/task classification from scope classification. Pass 1 decides whether the user goal is a social interaction (greeting, thanks, small talk) or a work request; Pass 2 (if work) classifies scope as trivial, simple, or complex. This separation resolves the semantic blind spot where acknowledgment+pivot phrasing ("Ok, now apply the fix") misroutes to social fast-path.

Both passes run structured LLM calls on the fast model. Pass 1 runs `asyncio.gather`-ed with checkpoint load and git status in stage 1; Pass 2 runs after stage 1 completes (only if Pass 1 returns `is_task=true`). A `route_by_intent` conditional edge after `init_or_resume` dispatches to chitchat, wired-subagent, trivial, simple, complex, and continuation overlays. A P0 hard routing guard blocks social-path when daemon has created a new goal record. The legacy binary intent classifier, its heuristic bypass (`_is_likely_agentic`), and the `simple_bypass` string-prefix detector are removed outright.

> **Supersession note (RFC-904):** When recursive step decomposition cuts over, **Pass 1 is retained** as the sole chitchat vs task gate. **Pass 2** (trivial/simple/complex) and complexity-tiered routing into plan/skip stations are **removed**. Task scope is discovered via do-or-decompose inside StrangeLoop. Wired-subagent and continuation overlays that do not depend on Pass 2 scope labels remain in force unless a follow-on IG retargets them.

---

## 2. Scope and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Scope

This RFC defines:

- A **two-pass intake architecture**: Pass 1 (social vs task) → Pass 2 (scope: trivial|simple|complex).
- Pass 1 prompt, schema, and context exclusion (no prior projection).
- Pass 2 prompt, schema, and context inclusion (prior projection for reference resolution).
- A `route_by_intent` conditional edge after `init_or_resume` driving intake branches (including wired-subagent, IG-599).
- A P0 hard routing guard: block social-path when `loop_state.new_goal_created`.
- Complexity-tiered planning: fresh-loop `trivial` skips `plan_generate`; fresh-loop `simple` runs lightweight; `complex` runs full spine. On continuation turns, `simple` routes through `plan_assess` discriminator first.
- The trivial-branch plan shape: goal-as-step-action, no synthetic reasoning message.
- Derived fields: `intake_label` and `has_deliverable` computed at routing.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

- Speculative first-task emission before the full plan completes (future "aggressive" variant).
- Plan-token streaming to the user as a draft.
- Embedding-based pre-filter of intent.
- Post-execution failure-intent keyword fast-path as primary classifier (migrated to LLM-first in IG-567; keyword path remains offline fallback).
- Changes to event envelopes or daemon transport framing (optional `loop_input.intake_scope` is an additive params field; see RFC-450).
- Changes to clarification relay (`RFC-622`) behavior.
- A feature flag or staged rollout — two-pass replaces one-pass outright.
- Fine-tuning pipeline for intake classification (future work).

## 3. Motivation

### 3.1 Semantic blind spot in one-pass taxonomy

The original one-pass design used a 4-class label: `chitchat|trivial|simple|complex`. The `chitchat` label conflated **interaction type** (social) with **scope** (no deliverable):

```
chitchat = "greeting/thanks/casual small talk" + "no work"
```

This created an overlap zone where acknowledgment+pivot phrasing misroutes:

| User GOAL | One-pass misroute | Correct classification |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| `Ok, now apply the signature change` | "Ok" → social → `chitchat` | Acknowledgment pivot → work (complex) |

This is a **systemic blind spot**, not a rare edge case. Any phrasing with social acknowledgment prefix + pivot phrase + terse engineering reference falls into the same trap.

### 3.2 Context dominance amplifies the blind spot

Prior-goal projection (IG-540) biases toward "wrap-up" tone on continuation loops. When user says "Ok, about the signature change" after a completed goal, the model sees prior completion + "Ok" and overweights "user is confirming" vs "user is pivoting to new request."

### 3.3 Unintelligent heuristic judgment (removed)

`IntentClassifier._is_likely_agentic` forced any query over 80 characters, 15 words, or 2 newlines to agentic path before LLM consultation. The `simple_bypass` string-prefix match recognized synthetic plans by prefix. Both are removed — LLM decides content, structural state decides routing constraints.

### 3.4 The resolution: Two-pass separation

Pass 1 asks a single clean question: "Is this social or work?" No scope, no prior context, no bias. Pass 2 (if work) asks: "How much scope?" with full context for reference resolution. The decision boundaries are distinct; the blind spot is architecturally removed.

---

## 4. Guiding Principles

1. **Separate decisions at the source.** Social vs task and trivial vs simple vs complex are different questions; different passes ask them.
2. **LLM over heuristic for content judgment.** Decisions about what the goal *means* are made by LLM, not string length or prefix matching.
3. **Partition context appropriately.** Pass 1 sees no prior projection (clean boundary); Pass 2 sees full projection (reference resolution).
4. **Fail safe.** Pass 1 uncertain → treat as task; Pass 2 uncertain → complex. Routing guard blocks social on structural contradiction.
5. **Preserve what works.** Fresh-loop skip (IG-476), continuation overlay (RFC-226), clarification relay (RFC-622) unchanged.

## 6. Component Responsibilities

### 6.1 Pass 1 Classifier (IntakePass1)

**Purpose**: Binary decision — is this a social interaction or a work request?

**Capabilities**:
- Returns `{is_task: bool, confidence, social_response?, reasoning}`.
- Social response included when `is_task=false` for fast-path END.
- No prior context projection — clean decision boundary.
- Ultra-lean prompt (~120 tokens).

**Interfaces**:
- Provides: `IntakePass1Classifier.classify(query) -> IntakePass1Result`.
- Requires: fast chat model.

**Prompt**:

```xml
<INTAKE_PASS1>
Classify: social interaction or work request?

SOCIAL: greeting, thanks, identity question, small talk, standalone acknowledgment ("ok", "sure" alone).
WORK: references code/files/APIs/tests; requests action; acknowledgment + pivot ("ok, now...", "about the X...", "next: Y").

Rules:
- Names technical entity → WORK
- Pivot phrase after acknowledgment → WORK
- Uncertain → WORK

JSON only:
{"is_task":bool,"confidence":"high"|"medium"|"low","social_response":"string|null","reasoning":"≤15 words"}

social_response required when is_task=false. Match user's language/tone. Identity: "I'm Soothe, created by Dr. Xiaming Chen."

Examples:
"hi" → is_task:false, social_response:"Hi! How can I help?"
"thanks!" → is_task:false, social_response:"You're welcome!"
"ok, now apply the fix" → is_task:true
"about the refactor — finish it" → is_task:true
"alright, so the tests..." → is_task:true
</INTAKE_PASS1>
```

### 6.2 Pass 2 Classifier (IntakePass2)

> **Removed 2026-10-07 — superseded by RFC-904.** The Pass 2 scope classifier
> (trivial / simple / complex), its prompt, schema, and prior-projection
> context packaging are removed. Task scope is discovered via do-or-decompose
> inside StrangeLoop (RFC-904 §Guiding Principles). Wired-subagent specialist
> selection remains slash/daemon `preferred_subagent` only (IG-669).

### 6.3 `route_by_intent`

**Purpose**: Branch dispatch after `init_or_resume`, with routing guard.

**Capabilities**:
- Pure function over graph state — testable without LLM.
- Checks routing guard first: `new_goal_created` blocks social-path.
- Priority: chitchat `fast_path` → **wired_subagent** → continuation overlays → fresh trivial/simple/complex.

**Routing guard (P0 hard constraint)**:

```python
if loop_state.new_goal_created and intake_label == "chitchat":
    intake_label = "complex"  # structural override
    log.warning("chitchat blocked by new-goal constraint, forcing complex")
```

**Interfaces**:
- Provides: conditional-edge target string for `init_or_resume`.
- Requires: `LoopGraphState.intake_label`, `intent_route`, `ctx.loop_state.new_goal_created`.

### 6.3.1 Wired-subagent direct route (IG-599 / IG-601)

When slash/daemon `preferred_subagent` resolves to an allowlisted specialist (`planner`, `browser_use`, `deep_research`, `academic_research`):

1. `init_or_resume` sets `intent_route=wired_subagent` when a specialist resolves (no plan inject here).
2. `route_by_intent` returns `invoke_wired_subagent` (after chitchat, before continuation).
3. `invoke_wired_subagent` emits delegation status (`plan_phase_status`), then looks up the specialist on the intake-only registry (not on CoreAgent `task`), runs the CompiledSubAgent runnable **without** resolve → execute, records execute-step Human(goal)+AI(report) on the CE ledger, then routes to `goal_completion`. See §6.3.3 for stream / TUI contract (orphan SubAgent card).
4. Final user-visible text uses the existing goal-completion path (`ledger_direct` / synthesize).

Content judgment for *which* specialist stays on the Pass 2 structured field (or explicit slash). Validation/coerce of names is deterministic allowlist filtering.

### 6.3.2 Intake-only vs task-catalog exposure (IG-600 / IG-601 / IG-656)

Built-in wire specialists are **intake-only**:

| Subagent | Intake / wired route | On CoreAgent graph / `task` | Plan-generate `delegate` |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `planner` | Yes (streamed direct invoke) | No | No |
| `browser_use` | Yes (streamed direct invoke) | No | No |
| `deep_research` | Yes (streamed direct invoke) | No | No |
| `academic_research` | Yes (streamed direct invoke) | No | No |

- Intake-only specialists live on a **parallel registry** (`SootheNanoAgent.intake_only_subagents`) and are **not** passed to `create_deep_agent` (IG-601). Wired intake streams their runnable (custom events forwarded) then completes.
- Open-hop `task` to intake-only names fails naturally (not registered); ToolEnforcement still rejects them as belt-and-suspenders.
- Plan-wave `delegate` is always stripped from generated steps; specialists are slash-only.
- Plugin / other open-catalog subagents may still appear on CoreAgent `task` when registered outside this set (not via plan-wave built-in `delegate`).

### 6.3.3 Intake-only wire: stream bridge and orphan SubAgent card

Intake-only specialists do **not** enter CoreAgent execute, so they never emit a main-graph `task` tool call and never parent a step card. Direct invoke must still provide TUI progress.

**Normative stream contract** (StrangeLoop → query stream → TUI):

| Phase | Emit | Required fields |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Before / as invoke begins | `plan_phase_status` («Delegating to {subagent}») | `label`, tokens as today |
| Start | `wired_subagent_started` | `subagent`, `invocation_id`, `step_id` (trivial-plan step id), `description` |
| Progress | Forward allowlisted `soothe.subagent.*` customs as `stream_event` (or equivalent) | Specialist payload + `invocation_id` (+ `step_id` when known) |
| End | `wired_subagent_completed` \| `failed` \| `cancelled` | `invocation_id`, `duration_ms`, `summary` / error |

**Streaming requirement**: bare `ainvoke` alone is insufficient for client progress. The intake-only path MUST run the specialist under a path where LangGraph custom/`get_stream_writer()` events are captured and re-emitted onto the StrangeLoop query stream (e.g. `astream` with `custom` mode, or an equivalent emit bridge). Worker log lines for wire events are audit-only and do not satisfy this contract.

**TUI**: The client mounts an **orphan SubAgent card** (no parent step widget, empty `parent_step_id` / `parent_task_key`) per RFC-628 Part III. After the card mounts, the thinking / plan-phase row MUST NOT remain the primary long-running progress surface.

**Non-goals for this section**: re-registering intake-only names on CoreAgent `task`; synthesizing a fake StrangeLoop step card solely to parent the SubAgent card.

### 6.4 `node_init_or_resume` (extended)

**Purpose**: Surface intake results onto graph state; inject minimal plan for trivial and wired-subagent branches.

**Capabilities**:
- Derives `intake_label` from Pass 1 + Pass 2 results.
- Derives `has_deliverable` at routing.
- For wired specialist: sets `intent_route=wired_subagent` (plan built in `invoke_wired_subagent`).
- For `trivial`: builds minimal 1-step plan into `ctx.scratch` (no allowlisted specialist).

### 6.5 `plan_phase.generate_lightweight`

> **Removed 2026-10-07 — superseded by RFC-904.** The lightweight plan call for
> the `simple` Pass 2 branch only existed to support complexity-tiered planning
> routes, which are removed. Plan generation folds into `decompose_task`
> (RFC-904).

### 6.6 `_run_strange_loop` (restructured)

**Purpose**: Orchestrate two-stage parallel pre-graph gather with two-pass intake.

**Capabilities**:
- Stage 1: `asyncio.gather(pass1, checkpoint.load, git_status)`.
- If `is_task=true`: Stage 2: `asyncio.gather(pass2, ce.load, to_thread(file_reads))`.
- If `is_task=false` and `should_bypass_social_gate_fast_path` (RFC-225 §5.5): coerce to task; proceed to Stage 2 and checkpoint recovery.
- If `is_task=false` otherwise: END immediately with `social_response` (no goal finalize on running checkpoints).

---

## 7. Data Flow

### 7.1 Pre-graph (parallelized)

**Stage 1:**
```
asyncio.gather(
    pass1_llm_call,
    state_manager.load(),
    get_git_status()
)
```

If `pass1.is_task == false`:
- If `should_bypass_social_gate_fast_path(checkpoint, goal)` (RFC-225 §5.5): treat as task; proceed to Stage 2 and checkpoint recovery.
- Else: emit `social_response` to user; END (chitchat fast-path). Chitchat MUST NOT finalize goals on `checkpoint.status == "running"` (RFC-225 §5.5).

If `pass1.is_task == true`:
- Proceed to Stage 2

**Stage 2:**
```
asyncio.gather(
    pass2_llm_call(prior_projection),
    ce_backend_construct + ce.load + create_goal/activate_goal,
    asyncio.to_thread(load_instructions, load_memory)
)
```

### 7.2 Graph (branch routing)

1. `init_or_resume` derives `intake_label` and `has_deliverable`.
2. Routing guard checks `new_goal_created`.
3. `route_by_intent` dispatches:
   - `chitchat` → END (social fast-path)
   - `wired_subagent` → `invoke_wired_subagent` → intake-only direct → `goal_completion`
   - `trivial` → `resolve_decision` → `validate` → `execute`
   - `simple` (fresh) → `plan_generate(lightweight)` → `resolve` → `validate` → `execute`
   - `complex` → `bounded_evidence_gather` → `plan_assess?` → `plan_generate` → `resolve` → `validate` → `execute`
   - continuation overlay:
     - `trivial` / `simple` → `plan_assess` (RFC-226) → `bootstrap` or `plan_generate`
     - `complex` → `bounded_evidence_gather` → full spine

---

## 8. Abstract Schemas

### 8.1 IntakePass1Result

```
IntakePass1Result {
  is_task: bool
  confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  social_response: string | null   // required when is_task=false
  reasoning: string                // ≤15 words
}
```

### 8.2 IntakePass2Result

> **Removed 2026-10-07 — superseded by RFC-904.** The Pass 2 result schema
> (`scope: trivial|simple|complex`, `goal_description`, `reasoning`,
> `multi_phase`, `requires_tool_use`) is removed; scope classification no
> longer runs at intake. Task scope is discovered via do-or-decompose
> (RFC-904).

### 8.3 Derived fields at routing

```
intake_label = "chitchat" if not is_task else scope
has_deliverable = is_task and scope != "trivial"
```

### 8.4 LoopGraphState

```
LoopGraphState += {
  intake_label: "chitchat" | "trivial" | "simple" | "complex"
  is_task: bool
  scope: "trivial" | "simple" | "complex" | null
}
```

### 8.5 Trivial-branch plan shape

> **Removed 2026-10-07 — superseded by RFC-904.** The synthetic trivial-branch
> 1-step plan shape (`status: "execute"`, single `StepAction` with
> `requires_tool_use`) only existed to support the Pass 2 `trivial` scope label.
> Under recursive decomposition, trivial work is discovered inside THREAD
> do-or-decompose (RFC-904), not pre-classified at intake.

### 8.6 Execute step deliverable gate (IG-569)

Trivial execute steps no longer require a `## Result` markdown block. Retry is
governed by a **Step Deliverable Gate**:

1. **Structural** — `requires_tool_use` + tool counts, successful RFC-211 outcomes,
   minimum final assistant text length (`execute_min_answer_chars`).
2. **Fast LLM assess** — optional when structural checks are inconclusive
   (`execute_deliverable_assess`: auto | always | never).

On retry, the executor injects a **failure-mode-specific** nudge (not a generic
tool prompt) and **replaces** the prior pass output (no concatenation). Goal
completion remains free-form via `ledger_direct` / synthesis.

---

## 9. Architectural Constraints

1. **Pass 1 has no prior context.** The social/task decision depends only on GOAL text; prior projection would bias toward wrap-up.
2. **Pass 2 has full prior context.** Scope classification needs reference resolution ("apply it") and continuation depth.
3. **Routing guard is hard constraint.** `new_goal_created` blocks social-path regardless of Pass 1 result — structural override.
4. **Fail-safe toward task.** Pass 1 `confidence=low` → treat as task; Pass 2 uncertain → `complex`.
5. **No retry on Pass 1.** Fail-safe immediately to Pass 2; Pass 2 routes appropriately regardless.
6. **Continuation is structural.** Pass 1/2 never decide continuation; derived from **this loop's** checkpoint (RFC-226 overlay). Loop-control phrases bypass Pass 1 social routing before END only when that checkpoint has intra-loop work to continue (RFC-225 §5.5); otherwise keep the Pass 1 social result.
7. **Clarification is emergent.** No pre-classified clarification branch; planner routes when it cannot plan.
8. **Chitchat is non-terminal on running loops.** Social fast-path MUST NOT finalize an active goal; only idle checkpoints may be closed via chitchat finalize (RFC-225 §5.5).

---

## 10. Branch Wiring

```
init_or_resume --(route_by_intent)--> {
  END                      // chitchat (blocked if new_goal_created)
  invoke_wired_subagent    // IG-599/656 specialist (intake-only → goal_completion)
  resolve_decision         // trivial (synth plan in scratch)
  plan_generate            // simple (fresh only)
  bounded_evidence_gather  // complex
  plan_assess              // continuation trivial/simple overlay
}
```

---

## 11. Error Handling

- **Pass 1 failure** — treat as task, proceed to Pass 2.
- **Pass 2 failure** — fallback `scope = complex`; full pipeline runs.
- **IO gather failure** — partial failures degrade gracefully (return_exceptions=True).
- **Mislabel risk** — `trivial` mislabeled `complex` pays extra plan call (latency, no correctness loss). `complex` mislabeled `trivial` produces 1-step plan; post-execution `plan_assess` catches on next iteration.
- **Routing guard activation** — log warning; forced `complex` route.

---

## 12. Migration

- **Direct replacement** — two-pass replaces one-pass in same change.
- **Removed** — legacy `IntentClassificationLLMResult`, `classify_intent`, `_is_likely_agentic`, `simple_bypass` prefix/detector, `chitchat` row in intake prompt.
- **Wire** — `IntentClassifiedEvent` is still derived from intake results. Optional additive `loop_input.intake_scope` (`trivial`|`simple`|`complex`) forces scope and skips Pass 1+2 LLM when set (RFC-450).

---

## 13. Testing

- **Pass 1 unit tests** — pivot patterns, technical entity references, pure social, fail-safe cases.
- **Pass 2 unit tests** — scope golden-set, continuation context, reference resolution.
- **Routing unit tests** — guard truth table, derived field computation.
- **Parallelization tests** — assert Pass 1 ∥ checkpoint ∥ git_status concurrent.
- **Branch integration tests** — visited node sequence per branch.
- **Latency regression test** — task query within budget (<200ms added).
- **Mislabel recovery test** — trivial on multi-step goal → replans on iteration 2.

---

## 14. Latency Impact

| Query type | Passes | Latency |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Social | Pass 1 only | Same as one-pass (one LLM call) |
| Task | Pass 1 + Pass 2 | ~100-200ms added |

Budget: relaxed (<300ms acceptable). Pass 1 ultra-lean (~50-80 tokens input, ~120 token prompt).

---

## 15. Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Pivot patterns (e47d-like) | Pass 1 → `is_task=true`, never social |
| Pure social regression | 100% remain social on eval set |
| False social-path rate | Near-zero |
| Added latency on task | <200ms median |
| Routing guard activation | <1% (structural contradiction rare) |
| Intake-only wire UX | Client receives `wired_subagent_started` + progress or terminal lifecycle; orphan SubAgent card mounted (not plan-phase-only) |

---

## 16. Open Questions

> **Removed 2026-10-07 — superseded by RFC-904.** All three open questions
> (Pass 2 prompt tuning, prior projection truncation for Pass 2 quality,
> Pass 2 retry policy) only applied to the Pass 2 scope classifier, which is
> removed.
