**Title**: Reasoning Quality & Progressive Actions
**Status**: Draft
**Kind**: Feature Enhancement
**Created**: 2026-04-09

## Abstract

Refactor the reasoning layer to ensure progressive action descriptions and comprehensive final reports. This RFC addresses IG-143 Issues #2 and #3 by implementing prompt engineering, post-processing, and an optional synthesis phase. Additionally improves **confidence** estimation with an evidence-based blend in `LLMPlanner` (`packages/soothe/src/soothe/sloop/cognition/planner.py`). **`goal_progress`** is the assess model’s own estimate (see §3.2); it is not blended with step/evidence ratios (IG-376).

---

## Motivation

### Problem 1: Non-Progressive Actions

Current behavior shows action descriptions regressing from specific back to generic:

```
Iteration 1: "Use file and shell tools..." (generic)
Iteration 2: "Use file and shell tools..." (repeated - NO PROGRESS)
Iteration 3: "List the root directory structure..." (specific - GOOD!)
Iteration 4: "Use file and shell tools..." (REGRESSED - BAD!)
```

**Impact**: Users cannot track planning progress, actions feel repetitive, degrades UX quality.

**Root Cause**: `soothe_next_action` field is LLM-generated without post-processing or progression tracking.

### Problem 2: Insufficient Final Reports

Current final reports:
```
✓ The Soothe project architecture has already been fully analyzed.
It's a Python-based system with ~18K lines across 338 files...
```

**Issues**:
- Says "already analyzed" instead of synthesizing findings
- Minimal detail (just line count and file count)
- No architecture breakdown
- No key components identified
- No design patterns explained

**Impact**: Users don't receive comprehensive, actionable summaries for complex goals.

**Root Cause**: `full_output` concatenates raw step results without synthesis.

### Problem 3: Unreliable Quality Metrics

LLM **confidence** benefits from calibration against execution outcomes. **`goal_progress`**, by contrast, is easier for users to interpret when it tracks the assess model’s judgment of how much of the goal the ledger satisfies, without a second hidden blend (IG-376).

**Impact**: Misleading confidence is mitigated with evidence-aware blending; `goal_progress` stays aligned with StatusAssessment output (plus completion heuristics where applicable).

## Specification

### 1. Progressive Actions

#### 1.1 Enhanced Prompts

**Location**: `src/soothe/sloop/prompts/fragments/instructions/output_format.xml`

Add new `<PROGRESSIVE_ACTIONS>` section requiring:
- Reference learnings from previous iterations
- Never repeat identical action text
- Progress from exploration → investigation → synthesis
- Explicit strategy pivots when stuck

**Action Evolution Pattern**:
- Iteration 1: Broad exploration
- Iteration 2: Targeted investigation
- Iteration 3: Deep analysis
- Iteration 4+: Synthesis and validation

#### 1.2 Action Post-Processing

**Status**: ❌ **REMOVED** (2026-04-10)

**Rationale**: The `action_quality.py` module was removed due to:
- Persistent integration issues (repetitions in production despite passing unit tests)
- Hardcoded keyword patterns requiring constant maintenance
- Prompt engineering (Section 1.1) provides sufficient guidance for progressive actions

**Replacement**: Rely entirely on `<PROGRESSIVE_ACTIONS>` prompt section as the primary mechanism. Action history tracking (Section 1.3) is retained for completion detection.

#### 1.3 Action History Tracking

**Schema Change**: Add to `LoopState`:
```python
action_history: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)

def add_action_to_history(self, action: str) -> None
def get_recent_actions(self, n: int = 3) -> list[str]
```

**Usage**: Record each iteration's `soothe_next_action` for deduplication.

---

### 2. Synthesis Phase

#### 2.1 Synthesis Trigger Logic

**Location**: `packages/soothe/src/soothe/sloop/engine/synthesis.py` (target / evolution)

**Class**: `SynthesisPhase`

**Trigger Criteria** (all must be met):

| Criterion | Threshold | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Step count | ≥ 2 | Enough evidence to synthesize |
| Success rate | ≥ 60% | Quality evidence |
| Evidence volume | ≥ 500 chars | Sufficient content |
| Unique steps | ≥ 2 | Multiple perspectives |

**Decision Logic**:
```python
def should_synthesize(self, goal: str, state: LoopState, reason_result: ReasonResult) -> bool
```

Evidence-based heuristics only (no keyword matching).

#### 2.2 Synthesis Generation

**Process**:
1. Classify goal type from evidence patterns (not keywords)
2. Build synthesis prompt with goal, evidence, type
3. Call LLM for synthesis
4. Return structured summary

**Goal Classification** (evidence-based):
- Architecture analysis: Multiple directories + layer mentions
- Research synthesis: Multiple findings counts
- Implementation summary: Code patterns
- General synthesis: Default

#### 2.3 Synthesis Prompt Template

**Location**: `src/soothe/sloop/prompts/fragments/instructions/synthesis_format.xml` (NEW)

**Requirements**:
- Do NOT say "already analyzed"
- Be specific with numbers, names, concrete findings
- Structure appropriately for goal type
- 300-600 words for complex goals

**Architecture Analysis Structure**:
- System Overview
- Architecture Layers
- Key Components
- Design Patterns
- Dependencies
- Notable Features

**Research Structure**:
- Key Findings
- Methodology
- Conclusions

**Implementation Structure**:
- What Was Built
- Implementation Details
- Usage

#### 2.4 Integration

**Location**: `packages/soothe/src/soothe/sloop/engine/strange_loop.py`

**Trigger Point**: After `reason_result.is_done()` returns True

**Process**:
1. Initialize `SynthesisPhase` with synthesis LLM client
2. Check `should_synthesize()`
3. If True, call `synthesize()` and update `full_output`
4. If False, use raw evidence concatenation
5. Emit completed event

**Error Handling**: If synthesis fails, fall back to raw `full_output`.

---

### 3. Quality Improvements

#### 3.1 Evidence-Based Confidence

**Location**: `packages/soothe/src/soothe/sloop/cognition/planner.py` (`_calculate_evidence_based_confidence`)

**Function**:
```python
def _calculate_evidence_based_confidence(
    state: LoopState,
    reason_result: ReasonResult,
) -> float
```

**Formula**:
```
confidence = (
    llm_confidence * 0.5 +
    success_rate * 0.3 +
    evidence_volume_score * 0.3 +
    iteration_efficiency * 0.4
) / 1.5
```

**Factors**:
- Success rate (30%): Percentage of successful steps
- Evidence volume (30%): 0 chars = 0.0, 2000+ chars = 1.0
- Iteration efficiency (40%): Progress per iteration

**Integration**: Applied at the end of `LLMPlanner.plan()` after `StatusAssessment` / `PlanGeneration` are combined into `PlanResult` (RFC-604; IG-329: plan-generate structured output is `plan_action`, `decision`, `next_action` only).

#### 3.2 Goal progress (LLM-only)

**Status**: **Superseded (IG-376, 2026-05-04)**

Earlier drafts described blending `goal_progress` with step-completion and evidence-growth ratios. That approach is **removed**. `PlanResult.goal_progress` is taken from **Phase 1 `StatusAssessment.goal_progress`** (and carried through `_combine_results`), except where completion fallback logic adjusts `status` / `goal_progress` for stuck loops.

**Rationale**: Numeric blending often disagreed with user-visible evidence and obscured the assess model’s answer; UX and prompts now emphasize a clear **Execute iteration** header in the plan-context human message (RFC-214) so the model can align `goal_progress` with the ledger and cycle index.

#### 3.3 Better Reasoning Guidance

**Location**: `src/soothe/sloop/prompts/fragments/instructions/output_format.xml`

Add `<REASONING_QUALITY>` section requiring:
- Cite specific evidence
- Quantify findings
- Justify status with evidence
- 2-4 concise sentences

**Example**:
```
"Analysis of src/ revealed 8 protocol files and 12 backend implementations.
Evidence shows a layered architecture with clear separation.
Progress: examined 60% of key directories.
Status=continue to examine remaining backends."
```

### 4. Schema Changes

#### 4.1 ReasonResult Updates

**Location**: `packages/soothe/src/soothe/sloop/state/schemas.py`

**New Fields**:

```python
synthesis_performed: bool = Field(
    default=False,
    description="Whether synthesis phase was run"
)

action_specificity_score: float | None = Field(
    default=None,
    ge=0.0,
    le=1.0,
    description="Post-processed specificity score"
)

evidence_quality_score: float = Field(
    default=0.0,
    ge=0.0,
    le=1.0,
    description="Calculated quality of evidence"
)
```

#### 4.2 LoopState Updates

**Location**: `packages/soothe/src/soothe/sloop/state/schemas.py`

**New Fields**:

```python
action_history: list[str] = Field(
    default_factory=list,
    description="Chronological action history"
)
```

**New Methods**:

```python
def add_action_to_history(self, action: str) -> None
def get_recent_actions(self, n: int = 3) -> list[str]
```

---

## Implementation Plan

Five work-streams (~5 days total): (1) Progressive Actions — `action_history` schema field + `<PROGRESSIVE_ACTIONS>` prompt section (`action_quality.py` post-processing was removed 2026-04-10 due to integration issues and hardcoded keyword patterns; rely on the prompt section + history tracking); (2) Quality Improvements — evidence-based confidence in `LLMPlanner` (`goal_progress` is assess-only per IG-376) + reasoning-quality prompt section; (3) Synthesis Phase — `SynthesisPhase` class, `synthesis_format.xml` prompt, trigger logic on step count/success rate/evidence volume; (4) Benchmarks — 10 reasoning-quality benchmark files under `benchmarks/reasoning-quality/`; (5) Testing & Documentation — `./scripts/verify_finally.sh` and real-world verification.

---

## Breaking Changes

No backward compatibility maintained. Remove `full_output` fallback (always synthesize or fail); replace confidence/progress calculations entirely; require specific actions (enhance if needed). Rationale: cleaner code, consistent quality, easier testing.

---

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Benchmark pass rate | ≥ 80% | 8/10 cases pass validation |
| Progressive actions | ≥ 85% | Actions improve in 6/7 multi-step cases |
| Synthesis quality | ≥ 90% | Comprehensive reports when synthesis triggered |
| Iteration efficiency | Within expected ranges | No runaway loops |

### Quality Metrics

**Before**:
- Actions: Generic and repeated
- Final report: ~100 words, minimal detail
- Confidence: LLM self-assessment only
- Progress: LLM estimate only

**After**:
- Actions: Progressive specificity (0% → 80%+ specific)
- Final report: 300-600 words, structured
- Confidence: Evidence-based (success + volume + efficiency)
- Progress: Step completion + evidence growth

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Fallback |
|------|------------|----------|
| Synthesis adds latency | Skip for simple goals (evidence heuristics) | Use raw evidence |
| Post-processing over-corrects | Only enhance repeated/generic actions | Keep original if uncertain |
| LLM ignores progressive prompts | Post-processing safety net | Accept some imperfection |
| Quality heuristics inaccurate | Conservative thresholds, log for tuning | Adjust thresholds |
| Synthesis quality poor | Strong prompt template | Fall back to raw evidence |

---

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Follow-ups**:
1. Template library for goal-type-specific synthesis
2. Action memory across sessions
3. ML models for synthesis benefit prediction
4. Streaming synthesis progress
5. Multi-model synthesis for different types
