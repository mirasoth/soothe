# After (unified)
agent:
  autonomous:
    enabled: false
    max_iterations: 10
    max_retries: 2
    max_parallel_goals: 3
```

**IG-407**: Unified strange_loop configuration under `agent.loop`.

| `soothe-cli` | CLI + TUI (`soothe` command) |
| `soothe` | Agent core (library) |
| `soothe-daemon` | Daemon server (`soothed` command) |
| `soothe-plugins` | Optional delegate subagents and community plugins |

**Dependency order**: `soothe-sdk` → `soothe-cli` → `soothe` → `soothe-daemon`

**Migration**:
- Previously: Single package `soothe` with all components
- Now: Separate packages with clear boundaries

### Added - PostgreSQL Multi-Database Architecture

**RFC-802**: Separate databases for lifecycle isolation.

```
PostgreSQL Cluster:
├── soothe_checkpoints  (LangGraph + StrangeLoop)
├── soothe_metadata     (Durability metadata)
├── soothe_vectors      (pgvector embeddings)
└── soothe_memory       (MemU long-term memory)
```

**Benefits**:
- Backup granularity
- Schema isolation
- pgvector extension requirements
- Performance optimization per workload

### Added - Protocol Resolver

Automatic protocol wiring from configuration:

```yaml
protocols:
  memory:
    enabled: true

    llm_embed_role: embedding
  planner:
    model: think
    routing: auto
  policy:
    profile: standard
  durability:
    backend: postgresql
```

Resolver maps config to backend implementations.

### Changed - Module Self-Containment (IG-047)

**Refactoring pattern**: Tests moved close to code they test.

```
packages/soothe/src/soothe/core/strange_loop/
├── graph.py
├── nodes.py

packages/soothe/tests/unit/core/strange_loop/
├── test_graph.py
├── test_nodes.py
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier test maintenance
- Clear source-to-test mapping
- Modular development

### Changed - Verification Script

`./scripts/verify_finally.sh` for pre-commit verification:

- Workspace integrity (`uv sync`)
- Dependency validation (SDK independence, CLI no daemon imports)
- Format + lint + unit tests
- Auto-fix mode (`--fix`)
- Quick mode (`--quick`)

**MANDATORY**: Run before every commit.

```python
register_event(MyCustomEvent, summary_template="Custom: {data}")
```

### Added - Thread Management

Persistent conversation threads:

- Thread directory: `~/.soothe/data/threads/<thread-id>/`
- Thread metadata: `thread_metadata.json`
