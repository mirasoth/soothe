# Core Modules Architecture

Soothe's core framework provides the foundational runtime for autonomous agent execution. This is an index of the core module knowledge articles — each linked page distills the architecture, design decisions, and integration points you won't find by reading source code alone.

---

## Where Core Fits

The `soothe` package implements a protocol-orchestrated agent runtime with **no transport or UI dependencies**. It sits between the CLI/daemon transport and the protocol/backend infrastructure:

```
CLI / Daemon  →  soothe (core runtime)  →  Protocols / Backends / LangGraph
```

The core package is intentionally decoupled from how queries arrive (CLI, WebSocket, autopilot dispatch) and from where state is stored (SQLite, PostgreSQL). This separation lets the same runtime power one-shot CLI commands, long-running daemon sessions, and autonomous multi-goal workflows.

---

## Three-Level Execution Model

Soothe organizes execution into three hierarchical tiers. See the [Architecture Overview](../architecture/index.md#three-level-execution) for the full conceptual model.

**Core module responsibilities**:

| Tier | Module | Scope | Key File |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| **ContextEngine** | [context-engine.md](context-engine.md) | Long-running multi-goal DAGs | `context/` |
| **StrangeLoop** | [strangeloop.md](strangeloop.md) | Single-goal iterative refinement | `sloop/` |
| **CoreAgent** | [agent-factory.md](agent-factory.md) | Model → Tools → Model turn loop | `coreagent/` |

Each tier delegates downward via **advisory hints** (passed through `config.configurable`) — CoreAgent never knows about goals, it only executes prompts with optional execution hints.

## Core Module Index

### Execution Runtime

- **[Agent Factory](agent-factory.md)** — CoreAgent construction. The `create_soothe_agent()` factory assembles tools, subagents, middlewares, and protocol instances into a compiled LangGraph. Covers the builder pattern, lazy initialization, and the CoreAgent/StrangeLoop contract.
- **[SootheRunner](runner.md)** — Top-level execution coordinator. Wraps CoreAgent with protocol pre/post-processing (policy validation, memory restore, context projection, checkpointing) and yields the canonical `soothe.*` event stream.
- **[StrangeLoop](strangeloop.md)** — Plan-Execute loop for single goals. The middle tier: LLM-driven planning via structured `PlanResult`, evidence accumulation, DAG-style step scheduling, and convergence detection.

### Goal & Context Management

- **[ContextEngine](context-engine.md)** — Autonomous goal management. Manages goal DAGs with dependencies, priorities, dynamic restructuring, backoff reasoning, and dreaming. The top tier for complex workflows.

### Infrastructure

- **[Event System](events.md)** — Centralized event infrastructure. Covers the `soothe.<domain>.<component>.<action>` naming convention, the internal vs. client-facing namespace split, visibility tiers, and the registry pattern.
- **[Protocol Resolver](resolver.md)** — Wires protocols from configuration to runtime instances. Handles checkpointer/durability resolution, the no-in-memory-fallback rule, and tool/subagent registry assembly.
- **[Workspace Management](workspace.md)** — Unified workspace resolution, path validation, and sandbox boundaries. Covers the `SOOTHE_WORKSPACE` priority chain, virtual mode semantics, thread/goal isolation, and the `FrameworkFilesystem` singleton.

## Supporting Modules

These modules don't have dedicated knowledge articles but are referenced throughout:

- **Middleware Stack** (`soothe.middleware`) — Soothe-specific middlewares assembled by `build_soothe_middleware_stack()`: `IdentityMiddleware` (JWT/identity), `SoothePolicyMiddleware` (policy enforcement), `SystemPromptMiddleware` (dynamic prompt), `LLMRateLimitMiddleware` (LLM-level rate limiting), `WorkspaceContextMiddleware` (thread-aware workspace), `PerTurnModelMiddleware` (per-stream model override), `SootheFilesystemMiddleware` (extended filesystem tools), `CodeInterpreterMiddleware` (embedded QuickJS), `MCPActivationMiddleware` (MCP progressive disclosure), `ToolTimeoutMiddleware` (tool call timeout), plus profiler and tool-context helpers.
- **Persistence** (`soothe.persistence`) — Artifact store and configuration-driven policy for run outputs.
- **Prompts** (`soothe.prompts`) — Host prompt construction: nano CoreAgent re-exports, StrangeLoop envelopes/ledger projection, context XML, and fragment loading.

## Quick Start

The two entry points for using the core framework:

```python
# Direct agent execution (CoreAgent only)
from soothe.core.agent import create_soothe_agent
agent = create_soothe_agent(config)
async for chunk in agent.astream("query", config={"thread_id": "t1"}):
    process(chunk)

# Protocol-orchestrated execution (full stack)
from soothe.runner import SootheRunner
runner = SootheRunner(config)
async for event in runner.run("query"):
    process(event)
```

Use `create_soothe_agent` directly for CoreAgent-only execution (tests, CLI one-shots). Use `SootheRunner` when you need protocol orchestration — thread lifecycle, policy validation, memory persistence, and the `soothe.*` event stream.
