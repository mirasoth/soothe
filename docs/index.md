# Soothe Documentation

> **Goal-driven orchestration framework for building 24/7 long-running autonomous agents**

Soothe is an *Agentic OS* that pushes humans **out of the execution loop**.
Built on LangChain / DeepAgents, it adds a persistent **agentic loop** and
**goal engine** that maintains context across sessions, sustains long-running
goals, coordinates multiple objectives, and autonomously steers complex tasks.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the complete stack
pip install -U soothe soothe-cli soothe-daemon

# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Initialize configuration
soothe config init

# Run your first query
soothe -p "List all Python files in the current directory and count lines of code"
```
